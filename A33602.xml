            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I had finiſhed the following Book, I was not long to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin under whoſe Patronage I ſhould make it publick; your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Extraordinry Knowledge in all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Antiquities, eſpecially that Part which relates to the <hi>Welch,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58558:3"/> juſtly claiming what I now make bold to offer to your Favour. For it ſeems to be as Natural a Deſign of a Dedication, to preſent one's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to the greateſt Judge, as to him who is the greateſt Encourager of his Writings; and if ſo, my Lord, this ſingle Reaſon would ſufficiently ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify me from any Preſumption, in ſubmitting the following Papers to your Lordſhip's Protection. But where the Obligation is corroborated by an equal Engagement; and ſince your Lordſhip has been pleaſed to encourage and promote the Deſign before it came to any Growth, I hope, I may ſafely preſent now in its perfect Strength and Vigor, what you were then pleaſed to receive in its Infancy.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of our Country, my Lord, has been ſo much neglected, that there ſeems a very great Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of reviving, what to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of the Kingdom, is almoſt loſt;
<pb facs="tcp:58558:3"/> and there are too many, otherwiſe very Learned Perſons, nay, ſome of our own Nation, who are ſo great Strangers to this Subject, that they are almoſt ignorant, that there is ſuch a Hiſtory in being.

In the mean time, if by the following Hiſtory, I can revive the Memories of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Princes therein contained, which in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtories, are either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally omitted, or but partially inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven,

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Hiſtory of the <hi>Britains,</hi> may not improperly be diſtinguiſhed into two Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods; the former comprehending the interval from <hi>Brute</hi> to <hi>Cadwalader,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Britains</hi> are thought to have enjoyed a general Poſſeſſion of the whole Iſland; the other contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Memoirs and Tranſactions of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> under their ſeveral Princes, after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to that part of the Iſland, ſince called <hi>Wales.</hi> The former of theſe has been generally accounted of late, abſolutely falſe and unhiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and 'tis undoubtedly concluded that all the Paſſages in <hi>Geoffrey</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> (the only remaining Monument of the Affairs of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Britains</hi>) which are not conſonant to, and agreeable with the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians that ſpeak of <hi>Britain,</hi> are abſolutely fabulous and unſincere. The Hiſtory of the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> has indeed met with better fortune, and the Author <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc</hi> of <hi>Lhancarvan</hi> is accounted juſt and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick; ſo that there need no other Apology for the following Work, than that it is for the beſt part the genuine Hiſtory of that Author. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Hiſtory of <hi>Wales</hi> has no ſmall depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon, and relation to the Hiſtory of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Britains</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> I think it
<pb facs="tcp:58558:5"/> neceſſary to make ſome general reflection, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Truth and Authority of that Copy.</p>
            <p>And here in the firſt place, I muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of two ſorts of Opinions, moſt widely repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and as I may ſay, diametrically oppoſite to each other; and both in my opinion, equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating from the right apprehenſion of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in debate. The one, perfectly rejecting the whole foundation and proceſs of <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, will not believe ſo much as one paſſage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the antient <hi>Britains,</hi> but what is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Roman</hi> Writers; as if nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able could happen in <hi>Britain,</hi> but what muſt needs fall under their ſpecial Cognizance and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The other, without any allowance to the Age when theſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> Affairs were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, (not to mention the utmoſt Antiquity of ſome part of this Hiſtory, cotemporary with which, nothing is certain among the more civilized <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>) will believe the whole Frame, and all the Circumſtances of <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Hiſtory, be they never ſo ridiculous and extravagant. But not to inſiſt on ſo bigotted an Opinion, as to think that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory is univerſally true, and altogether authentick; I will confine my ſelf to the examination of the other Extream, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Hiſtory publiſhed by <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> be ſo abſolutely fabulous as is frequently repreſented, and generally believed. Now they who diſcredit this Hiſtory, either wholly attribute the Frame and Invention of it to <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> or elſe granting him to be a faithful Tranſlator, aſſure themſelves that the Copy he received was fictitious, and perfectly owing to the unwarrantable Forgeries of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous Monks. So that the ſubject of my preſent enquiries, will naturally fall under thoſe two
<pb facs="tcp:58558:5"/> Diſquiſitions; <hi>1.</hi> Whether <hi>Geoffrey</hi> be the real Contriver and Compoſer of this Hiſtory? And <hi>2ly,</hi> Suppoſing him to be innocent of this Suſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, whether the Hiſtory publiſhed by him, be perfectly fabulous, and in all reſpects a Monkiſh Legend?</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> As to what relates to <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> though me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks there need no greater Argument to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence his Innocency from ſo ſuſpected an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, as his being the Contriver of this Hiſtory, than that be profeſſedly owns the receipt of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manuſcript from <hi>Walter,</hi> Arch Deacon of <hi>Oxford;</hi> yet becauſe the Prejudice of ſome Men oftentimes obſcures their Underſtanding, in things otherwiſe very clear and open, it will be requiſite to dwell ſomewhat more particularly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Subject: or if the World be once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that the whole Invention is owing to <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> and that there was no ſuch Account of the <hi>Britains</hi> in being, before he publiſhed his, Hiſtory; the whole ſeries of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Affairs not mentioned in the Writings of the <hi>Roman</hi> Authors, and all that long continued Succeſſion of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings for ſo many Ages, muſt of neceſſity be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted fabulous, and a perfect Legend. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> ſhould be ſo unreaſonably at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted of ſuch notorious Forgery, and his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be ſo generally condemned; one might expect that ſuch evident Proofs could be produced to evince ſo abſolute a Poſition, as to render it paſt all Diſpute and Contradiction. For to charge any one with Inſincerity, for no other reaſon, than becauſe it is the common Vogue and Sentiment of the World, is in my opinion a greater Argument of Partiality and Prejudice, than of ſolid and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Reaſoning.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58558:6"/>
            <p>Now the greateſt reaſon that I can think of, why the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory is attributed to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> is, that almoſt upon its firſt appearance in the World, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> and <hi>Geraldus Cambrenſis</hi> exclaim a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, and ſeem to lay the whole Impoſture to the charge of <hi>Geoffrey.</hi> The words of <hi>Newbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> are theſe; <hi>At contra quidem</hi> (ſpeaking before of <hi>Gildas) noſtris temporibus pro ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piandis his Britonum maculis ſcriptor emerſit, ridicula de iiſdem figmenta contexens, eoſque longè ſupra virtutem Macedonum &amp; Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum impudenti vanitate attollens. Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridus hic dictus eſt, Agnomen habens Arturi, pro eo quod fabulas de Arturo ex priſcis Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonum figmentis ſumptas, &amp; ex proprio au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctas per ſuperductum Latini ſermonis Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, honeſto hiſtoriæ nomine palliavit. Qui etiam majori auſu, cujuſdam Merlini divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones fallaciſſimas, quibus utique de proprio plurimum adjecit, dum eas in Latinum tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>funderet, tanquam Authenicas, &amp; immobili veritate ſubnixas prophetias vulgavit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From this Paſſage it is apprehended, that <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> thought that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory was ſolely owing to the Contrivance and Invention of <hi>Geoffrey;</hi> whereas nothing is more evident, than that the only thing he lays to <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s charge, is, that he augmented, and of his own head made Additions to the Copy he received. And ſeeing that <hi>Newborough</hi> expreſly mentions <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s tranſlating into Latin, ſome antient Figments of the <hi>Britains</hi> concerning King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and unwarrantably adding to the ſame; it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly apparent, that be never took <hi>Geoffrey</hi> to be the Contriver of the whole of what he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,
<pb facs="tcp:58558:6"/> otherwiſe it is hardly conceivable, that ſuch an inveterate Enemy of that Hiſtory, would conceal any thing that might derogate from the Truth and Authority of it. Beſides, <hi>Newborough</hi> throughout his whole Preface, wherein be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to invallidate, and render the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory fabulous, chiefly inſiſts upon the Life of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and the Prophecies of <hi>Merlyn;</hi> not a word of <hi>Brutus</hi> and his <hi>Trojans,</hi> which, thô <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But as his Arguments againſt <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Hiſtory are weak and invalid, and his whole Preface more an Invective than a Confutation, ſo his Credit ſhould be rejected and undervalued, for charging another Hiſtory with falſhood, when his own ſeems wholly interwoven with ridiculous Legends and Monkiſh Fictions.</p>
            <p>But be the occaſion of <hi>Newborough</hi>'s diſlike of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory what it will, 'tis evident, that nothing can be concluded from the above quoted Paſſage, more than that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> made Additions to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Copy be received of the Archdeacon of <hi>Oxford.</hi> And this is no more than what may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and ſafely be granted; for the Life of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and the Prophecies of <hi>Merlyn,</hi> the main Subjects of <hi>Newborough</hi>'s Diſcontent, may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be inſerted into the Hiſtory by <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> at leaſt they were augmented, and ſeveral Traditions were added by him. <hi>Bale,</hi> aſſures us, that he writ the Life of King <hi>Arthur</hi> in a diſtinct Treatiſe and himſelf owns in the Preface to his fourth Book, which comprehends the Prophecies of <hi>Merlyn,</hi> that upon the Requeſt of <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> he had tranſlated <hi>Merlyn</hi>'s Prophecies out of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> before the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Copy came to his Hands. Now, when <hi>Geoffrey</hi> had received the Manuſcript from the Archdeacon, and was engaged in tranſlating it into <hi>Latin,</hi> 'tis no ſtrange matter to imagine, that as occaſion required, he might am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify, and add to it, out of his former Tracts.

            <p>The other Reaſon,<note place="margin">Camb. <hi>Deſcript. Cap.</hi> 7.</note> why <hi>Geoffrey</hi> is thought to be the Author of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, is grounded upon a Paſſage in <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis,</hi> who ſpeaking of the Etymology of <hi>Wales,</hi> rejects the Denomination of it from either Duke <hi>Wallo,</hi> or Queen <hi>Wendolen, ſicut fabuloſa Galfredi Arturi mentitur Hiſtoria.</hi> Now this is thought an invicible Argument againſt <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> and a palpable detection of his inſincerity, ſince <hi>Giraldus,</hi> his own Country-man ſtrikes at him, and accuſes him of Forgery; whereas upon nicer examination, we may eaſily diſcover how that <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus</hi> quarrels only with the Hiſtory which <hi>Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> publiſhed, and which upon that account bore his Name. For had <hi>Giraldus</hi> though it to be only a Contrivance of <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s, had he ſuſpected that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> falſly pretended to have received an
<pb facs="tcp:58558:8"/> antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manuſcript, and by that means to have impoſed upon the World; Can it be ſuppoſed that upon ſo plain Conviction of falſhood, he would believe and give Credit to an Hiſtory, which he was ſatisfied was altogether a Fable? But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, we find him aſſenting to the Story of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and the diviſion of the Iſland betwixt his three Sons; and in ſhort, excepting in this one place, he expreſſes himſelf to be an abſolute Votary of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, whence 'tis evident, he apprehended <hi>Geoffrey</hi> to be no more than a faithful Tranſlator of an antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Copy.</p>
            <p>I need not take notice of <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> becauſe that by the beſt account, he is ſuppoſed to have been dead before <hi>Geoffrey</hi> publiſhed his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and conſequently he could never ſee it; ſo that this Expreſſion in him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> I.</note> 
               <hi>Hic eſt Arthurus de quo Britonum Nuge hodicque delirant,</hi> muſt likely refer to the then preſent Traditions and Accounts of the <hi>Welch</hi> concerning King <hi>Arthur,</hi> which proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly might be too great and extravagant. For 'tis certain that a traditional Account of any Perſon or Action, the farther it recedes from the Spring and Original, the more corrupt and imperfect it ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; and like a Ball of Snow, it gathers and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in its journey; ſo that it may be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that the vulgar Account which the <hi>Welch</hi> in <hi>Malmsbury</hi>'s time delivered of King <hi>Arthur,</hi> was too far incredible and ſurpriſing.</p>
            <p>But ſince the Reaſons produced for proving <hi>Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> to be the Author of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, ſeem not to be ſatisfactory and evincing; let us ſee whether the contrary aſſertion can be more reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably maintained. And firſt, 'tis manifeſt that <hi>Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi> could not be the total Inventor of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, by reaſon that ſeveral things, and ſome of
<pb facs="tcp:58558:8"/> the moſt material Paſſages therein contained, are agreeable with the Hiſtories of <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Nen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> the Poetical Fragments of <hi>Talieſſyn,</hi> not to mention the <hi>Saxon</hi> Manuſcript,<note place="margin">Notes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Bede.</hi>
               </note> quoted by Mr. <hi>Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> and other Authors far more antient than <hi>Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey.</hi> 'Tis owned indeed <hi>Geoffrey</hi> might borrow the ground and Plat-form of his Romance from <hi>Merlyn</hi> or <hi>Talieſſyn,</hi> or rather from <hi>Nennius,</hi> in whoſe Writings there is ſome ſlight Account of the <hi>Britains</hi> being deſcended from the <hi>Trojans;</hi> but the ſuperſtructure is all his own, who living in an ignorant Age, and well knowing he could not well be diſproved, took the Liberty to make what Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he pleaſed, and then recommended it to the World, for a true, undoubted Hiſtory. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this conceſſion, I think there is as little reaſon to attribute the Frame and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this Hiſtory to <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> as there can be, to think him Contriver of the Ground and Plot of it. For it ſeems to me very unaccountable, that if <hi>Geoffrey</hi> was to invent and compoſe this Hiſtory, why in this account of the Tranſactions betwixt the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> he ſhould ſo widely diſagree with, and deviate from the Writings of the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians. For certainly, nothing could add more Authority to a Fable, than exactly to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſteps of creditable Authors, in thoſe things they both had occaſion to treat of. This in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, would not only render that part of the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory unſuſpicious, but likewiſe Credit and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the reſt, of which there was no account in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Authors. And this diſagreement betwixt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, and the Writings of the Roman Hiſtorians, tho' frequently produced to overthrow the Authority of it, induces me to believe, not only that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> was not the Author, but likewiſe that the
<pb facs="tcp:58558:9"/> Manuſcript was antient, and much elder than the time, in which it was firſt made publick.</p>
            <p>But beſides, <hi>Geoffrey</hi> dedicates his Tranſlation to <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> Son to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, which in all likelihood he would never have ventured to do, had the Original been of his own Contrivance, for fear leaſt that the Cheat being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, he ſhould be found, to put upon a Perſon of Eminent Quality, with whom the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory was then in great Eſteem. For to him it is that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> owns the Receipt of this Manuſcript from the Archdeacon of <hi>Oxford,</hi> which he affirms to be very antient, and by his Requeſt was perſuaded to tranſlate it into the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue. It was a very eaſie matter for the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> to find out <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Integrity, by enquiring of the Archdeacon (who by all Accounts is reckoned his co-temporary) whether he had delivered ſuch an antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Copy into <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s hands, and whether the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation juſtly anſwered the Original. Theſe Enquiries were natural, upon the publication of any new Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, which made ſuch conſiderable noiſe and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the World, and which gave ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the antient <hi>Britains,</hi> as was never before thought or heard of among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. And ſuppoſing the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> to have omitted theſe Enquiries, yet it is ſcarce conceivable, but that in caſe of ſo open a Forgery, the Archdeacon would diſcover the Cheat, unleſs it can be thought that he was privy to, and had a hand in the Contrivance. But he was ſo far from detecting <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, that he himſelf owns too, to have tranſlated the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory firſt into <hi>Latin,</hi> and then in his latter days, to <hi>Britiſh</hi> again from the <hi>Latin,</hi> as may he ſtill ſeen in the <hi>Archives</hi> of <hi>Jeſus</hi>-College Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary. Now if there be any heed to, or dependance upon
<pb facs="tcp:58558:9"/> this, if it be true, that the Archdeacon did tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate, and conſequently allow of this Hiſtory, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very evident to me, that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> can be in no wiſe the Author or Contriver of it.</p>
            <p>But that <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> took a fancy to <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Tranſlation, more upon the account that his Father had lately ſubdued the <hi>Welch,</hi> and therefore ſeemed to add to his Father's Glory, than that he did credit and believe the Hiſtory, does not ſeem to be ſo true and evincing. For wherein could the publication of this Hiſtory contribute to the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Father's Name? Was it becauſe he had Conquered a People, whoſe Anceſtors appeared by this Hiſtory, to be formerly Valiant and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like? This was performed by others before him, and I can conceive no great addition to any Man's Fame, to Conquer a handful of People with a numerous Army, tho' their Fore-fathers had been Stout and Victorious. This is ſurely too ſlight a Pretence for the reception of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory by the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and too weak an Argument to deſtroy the Truth and Authority of it. 'Tis certain, that it took exceeding well in the World at that time, nor was it oppoſed till after <hi>Robert</hi>'s Death, when <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Newborough</hi> more out of Malice and Diſcontent, than any Love he bore to Truth, began to charge both the Original and Tranſlator with inſincerity. I cannot ſee, upon the whole, the leaſt Reaſon, why the Contrivance and Invention of this Hiſtory ſhould he attributed to <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> or that the Authority of it depends any way upon him, more than the Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Tranſlation. I ſhall therefore conclude this Subject with the Character beſtowed upon <hi>Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey,</hi> and the Hiſtory by him publiſhed by <hi>Ponticus Virunnius,</hi> who flouriſhed in the Year <hi>1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>2.</hi> But ſuppoſing <hi>Geoffrey</hi> to be innocent from this ſuſpected Impoſture, and that he did no more than faithfully tranſlate a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manuſcript he received of the Archdeacon; it may be farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that ſeeing it abounds with ſo many unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable matters of fact, and ſo extravagant Fables and Prodigies, it appears extreamly ſuſpicious, and ſenſibly ſmells of a Monkiſh production. For how is it poſſible, you will ſay, that any Account, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting what is found in the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtories, could be had of the <hi>Britains,</hi> and that not only before, but even after their ſubjection to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſince there is much reaſon to doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Britains,</hi> as well as other unlattered Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, had any means to convey any Knowledge to Poſterity, for want of the Art of Writing? For if the Affairs and Tranſactions of the <hi>Britains</hi> were only handed down by Tradition, and they had no other way or method to preſerve their Memories, then certainly all Pretences to antient Records, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to this <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manuſcript, ſuppoſed to have been tranſlated by <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be vain and groundleſs.</p>
            <p>And thus it is ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Britains</hi> had no Writing among them, neither before nor after the <hi>Roman</hi> Conqueſt; whence it follows, that there is no true nor certain account of any matter tranſlated among them, but what is recorded in <hi>Roman</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.

               <note place="margin">Britan. <hi>p.</hi> 158.</note> namely, becauſe <hi>Gildas</hi> makes no mention of <hi>Brute</hi> and his <hi>Trojans,</hi> he concludes that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory muſt be a real Fiction; whereas <hi>Gildos</hi> in this place manifeſtly declares his deſign only of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Hiſtory of the <hi>Britains,</hi> during their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. But as to this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Gildas,</hi> if in his time, there were no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his Anceſtors left in writing; I would fain learn upon what Ground and Authority, he could ſo poſitively aſſert that the <hi>Britains</hi> from their firſt Plantation in this Iſland, were proud and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
<pb facs="tcp:58558:12"/> and their Kings cruel and tyrannical. For a little before the above quoted paſſage, he ſays of Britain, <hi>Hæc erecta Cervice &amp; mente ex quo inhabitata eſt, nunc Deo, interdum Civibus, nonnunquam etiam tranſmarinis Regibus ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta conſurgit.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Tacens vetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtos immanium Tyrannorum annos, qui in aliis pofitis regionibus vulgati ſunt.</hi> Here he paſſes his Judgment very liberally upon the State and Condition of <hi>Britain</hi> from all Antiquity; and yet by and by, be confeſſes, that he had no guide to direct him to the Knowledge of thoſe times he ſo freely cenſures; ſo that if he had not the Spirit of Divination, he may falter in his conjectures, or elſe he was guided by ſome <hi>Britiſh</hi> Light, of which he was not willing to own the peruſal.</p>
            <p>But allowing that <hi>Gildas,</hi> in compoſing that ſmall Fragment of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, received no Light from any <hi>Britiſh</hi> Record, but was conſtrained to borrow out of the Writings of Foreigners; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes no farther, than that he had not the good Fortune to meet with <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manuſcripts, not that there were none really remaining in <hi>Britain.</hi> And farther, ſuppoſing that in <hi>Gildas</hi> his time, there were no remains of the antient <hi>Britains</hi> left in this Iſland, but were all utterly loſt; yet according to <hi>Gildas</hi> his own acknowledgment, and upon the <hi>Saxons</hi> prevailing in the Country, they might be carried over by the exuled <hi>Britains</hi> to <hi>Armories,</hi> from whence the Archdeacon of <hi>Oxford</hi> is ſaid to have brought over the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Copy be delivered to <hi>Geoffrey.</hi> But if there was no written Account of the former State of <hi>Britain,</hi> in the Age of <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> how comes it to paſs, that any ſuch thing ſhould be diſcovered and brought to light in ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages. And not to inſiſt upon the Authority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manuſcript tranſlated by <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> we have good reaſon to preſume, that the antient <hi>Britains</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:58558:13"/> before <hi>Gildas</hi> had hath Eccleſiaſtical and Civil Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of their Country.</p>
            <p>As to the former, <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>de,</hi> whoſe Authority I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, will not be queſtioned, expreſly affirmed it. For in his Preface to his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> he ſays, <hi>A principio itaque Voluminis hujus, uſque ad tempus quo Gens Anglorum fidem Chriſti percepit, ex priorum maxime ſcriptis hinc inde collectis, ea quæ promemoramus, didiſcimus.</hi> Here <hi>Bede</hi> plainly declares, that in Writing a Church Hiſtory of <hi>Britain,</hi> he extracted all his matter, before the converſion of the <hi>Saxons</hi> to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, out of antient Authors. But who can theſe former Writers be?

               </gap>s; not to queſtion, whether the <hi>Saxons</hi> before their Conuerſion had any Writing or Learning at all among them. For though it be pretended, that the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who uſe the ſame manner of Writing, borrowed their Characters from the <hi>Saxons;</hi> yet 'tis extremely ſuſpitious, that theſe received them from the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> if not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the <hi>Britains.</hi> As to the former, it is well known, that during the Diſturbances betwixt the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> here in <hi>Britain,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions of the <hi>Goths, Vandals,</hi> and other Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Nations into other Countries; all the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Weſtern Parts of the World, fled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> which for a conſiderable time remained
<pb facs="tcp:58558:13"/> to be the Nurſery of Learning and learned Men.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Saxons,</hi> long after their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to Chriſtianity, retired to <hi>Ireland</hi> for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, we have the Teſtimony of their antient and moſt authentick Hiſtorian; ſo that, I think,<note place="margin">Bed.

Eccl. lib. 3. chap. 27.</note> 'tis no Preſumption to ſuſpect, that as the <hi>Saxons</hi> borrowed their Learning from the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> they might for the ſame reaſon, receive their Characters and form of writing from them. But 'tis again to be doubted, whether both the <hi>Saxons</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh</hi> did not primarily derive their Characters from the <hi>Britains:</hi> For though the Britiſh Language <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he now writ in a different Character from the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and <hi>Saxon,</hi> yet upon antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents and Inſcriptions, moſt of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, different from the preſent <hi>Roman</hi> Alphabet, are plainly to be ſeen. Nor was this Character originally <hi>Britiſh,</hi> the ſame being uſed in the firſt Age of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire,<note place="margin">De Re Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plo. p. 345.</note> if we can lay any ſtreſs on <hi>Julius Ceſar</hi>'s Will and Teſtament, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented by <hi>Mabillon.</hi> But farther yet; if the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Character be originally <hi>Saxon,</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> muſt either bring it along with them from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> or elſe they muſt have invented it after their arrival and ſettlement in <hi>Britain:</hi> If the firſt, it may ſeem wonderful, how it came to be quite loſt and forgotten in all parts of <hi>Germany;</hi> unleſe we can ſuppoſe, that it was limited only to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and that they to a Man came and ſettled in this Iſland: For no body can be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that not only the <hi>Germans,</hi> but the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> too, uſe the <hi>Latine</hi> Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; which, if we ſuppoſe them to have but lately borrowed, yet in all probability, their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Letter was <hi>Gothick</hi> or <hi>Runick,</hi> to which the <hi>Saxon</hi> bears no great reſemblance. But if <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t be ſaid, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> invented this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter after their coming to <hi>Britain;</hi> I cannot well
<pb facs="tcp:58558:14"/> conceive, why they ſhould put themſelves to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary trouble, when with far greater eaſe and facility they might copy and borrow from the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains;</hi> unleſs the odium betwixt both Nations made them ſcorn to ape and imitate an Enemy. But be it ſo, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> invented this Character in <hi>Britain;</hi> it will follow, that they had no Letters nor Learning before they came over; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that theſe Authors which <hi>Bede</hi> mentions to have tranſcribed out of, could not be <hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the civil part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, that the Tranſactions of State were recorded, and that Copies thereof came to the hands of Poſterity, we have the expreſs Teſtimony of <hi>Nennius,</hi> who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed about Three Hundred Years after <hi>Gildas</hi> For in his Preface to his Hiſtory of the <hi>Britains,</hi> he openly declares, that he compos'd his Hiſtory, <hi>Partim majorum Traditionibus, partim Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptis, partim etiam Monumentis veterum Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae Incolarum.</hi> Here <hi>Nennius</hi> ſays, that he partly extracted his Hiſtory out of the Writings of the Antient <hi>Britains.</hi> And what could theſe Writings be? Certainly, they were not the Works of <hi>Gildas,</hi> the only <hi>Britiſh</hi> Author we read of before <hi>Nennius;</hi> upon the account that the Hiſtory of <hi>Nennius</hi> is much larger, and far more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete than that of <hi>Gildas;</hi> this latter, beſides the Names of a few <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings, having left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Hiſtorical to Poſteritty; the main, it ſeems of his deſign being to rail, and to inveigh againſt his Countrey, to which he had taken ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. From whence then elſe could <hi>Nennius</hi> extract the Materials of his Hiſtory? Why, 'tis reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that from ſome <hi>Britiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, which poſſibly might be recovered ſince the time of <hi>Gildas;</hi> And if then, why might not more be diſcovered ſince <hi>Nennius,</hi> and that delivered to <hi>Geoffrey</hi> by the Arch-Deacon of <hi>Oxon,</hi> be one?</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:58558:14"/>
            <p>But beſides, That the <hi>Britains</hi> kept Memorials of their Tranſactions, we may rationally gather from the Conſtitution and Profeſſion of the <hi>Bards. Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>But that the <hi>Bards</hi> did not only commit to memory the famous Deeds of their Princes and Heroes, and ſo recite and repeat them upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions; but alſo that they wrote down and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded what they repeated, we have the ample Teſtimony of <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cambr. Deſcrip. cap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Hoc etiam mild notandum videtur, quòd Bardi Cambren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; Cantatores ſeu Recitatores, genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giam habent Prædictorum Principum in libris eorum antiquis &amp; authenticis, ſed tamen Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brice ſcriptam, eandémque memoriter tenent à Roderico Magno uſque ad Belinum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, &amp; inde uſque ad Silvium, Aſcanium, &amp; Æneam; &amp; ab Æneâ uſque ad Adam, Generationem linealiter producunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that the Genealogies here mentioned by <hi>Giraldus,</hi> were not only a bare account of the ſeveral Deſcents and Succeſſions of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings, but alſo ſome Memorials of their Lives and Actions, may be eaſily gathered from the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Manners and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Bards.</hi> And ſeeing theſe <hi>Bards</hi> did preſerve not only in Memory but in Writing too, the lineal Succeſſion
<pb facs="tcp:58558:15"/> and moſt famous Tranſactions of their Kings; I ſee no reaſon why the Hiſtory of <hi>Geoffrey</hi> may not, as to a great part of it, pretend to greater Authority than is generally attributed to it. And if it be objected, that the <hi>Bards,</hi> by a Poetical Liberty out did the Truth of Hiſtory, in the Praiſes of thoſe Princes they were to celebrate; yet thus far it may reaſonably be acknowledged, that the Names and Succeſſion of the ſeveral Kings are real, and conſequently that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> could never be the Inventer of ſo large a Liſt of Nick-Names, as he is generally thought to be. For it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the Hiſtory of the <hi>Britains</hi> tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> was compoſed partly out of theſe Genealogies peculiar to the <hi>Bards,</hi> and partly out of any other Records and Monuments of the <hi>Britains;</hi> both which I have ſhewn to have been preſerved, and uſed among them antiently.</p>
            <p>But to deſcend to the particulars of this Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the firſt and moſt ſuſpicious Relation, is that of the landing of <hi>Brute</hi> with a Colony of <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi> the ſeveral Croſſes and Encounters he ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Voyage; and then of this Iſland receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Name from him. Should we indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the particular Circumſtances of this Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we might upon good reaſon be ſatisfied of the Vanity and falſeneſs of them; but therefore to conclude, that becauſe the Building is ſuſpicious, the Foundation conſequently muſt be fabulous, and a perfect Contrivance; does, I think, deſerve ſome better Examination: For if we do but reflect upon the contemporary Hiſtories of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> thoſe more polite and literate Nations, we may with equal pretence of Reaſon affirm, that there is no foundation for any matter of Fact be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Olympiads; or that the relation of <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s coming to <hi>Italy,</hi> and all that Hiſtory, to the Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> are altogether groundleſs and
<pb facs="tcp:58558:15"/> impertinent, becauſe they are intermixt with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and impoſſibilities. <hi>Livy</hi> aſſures us, that all the Tranſactions before the Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> are rather owing to Poetical Fancy and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies, than to any true and certain Matter of Fact; and therefore be declin'd to give either his Aſſent or Diſſent, to any thing related of thoſe Times:<note place="margin">Praefat.</note>

            <p>But for all their own Hiſtorians do allow that the Hiſtory of thoſe Times are fabulous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; yet there are none that queſtion the being of <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and that the <hi>Romans</hi> were deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from him. The like may be urged for the Hiſtory of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and the landing of the <hi>Trojans</hi> in this Iſland; that though many particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are fabulous, and entirely poetical, yet it does not thence neceſſarily follow, that there is no manner of ground or foundation for ſuch a Relation. Neither is it ſufficient Conviction, to urge, that the very being of <hi>Brute</hi> is all a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, by reaſon that the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtorians make no mention of ſuch a Perſon to be the Son of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius;</hi> becauſe, that through the whole Succeſſion from <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Romulus,</hi> the Hiſtories of thoſe Times take notice only of the Son that was to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; it being unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that all the Kings of <hi>Latium</hi> during that period, ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb facs="tcp:58558:16"/> each of them, but one Son. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what by the obſcurity of thoſe Ages, and what by bearing regard only to the Line of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, many collateral Princes eſcaped the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of future Hiſtorians. Nor is it enough to affirm, that the Hiſtory of <hi>Brute</hi> is but lately known and diſcovered to the World, whereas the fabulous <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory has been recorded from Antiquity; becauſe, that though we are not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory has been handed down to Poſterity in Writing; yet we are ſure, that it was an antient Tradition, long before <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s publiſhing of it; and one ſhould think, that an antient National Tradition, might require a ſtricter Examination, than haſtily to throw it aſide, as fabulous and of no Conſequence.</p>
            <p>But the Queſtion is not, Whether the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, as related by <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> be, as to all the Circumſtances of it, true and real Matter of Fact; for that, no Man, I preſume, can reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly maintain; but whether there be any ground or foundation of Truth couched under theſe Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and fabulous Narratives. Now the firſt thing we meet with in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, is, an Account of <hi>Brutus</hi> his Pedigree, how he was deſcended from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> and having acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſlain his Father <hi>Silvius,</hi> how he was forced to flee into <hi>Greece,</hi> whence, after ſeveral Scuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles with <hi>Pendraſus,</hi> a petty Prince of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he thought fit to retire, and to ſeek his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune by Sea. But he had not wandered long, when he met with <hi>Corinaeus,</hi> with another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of deſolate <hi>Trojans,</hi> with whom having joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Forces, he followed the Counſel of the Oracle, and at laſt arrives in this Iſland, from him afterwards called <hi>Britain.</hi> Now as to the particular Circumſtances related in the Life of <hi>Brutus,</hi> they may properly be placed in the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:58558:16"/> Claſs with <hi>Homer</hi>'s account of the Travels of <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> or <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Deſcription of <hi>Aeneas</hi> his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to <hi>Italy;</hi> that is to ſay, that they are Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>As to what is objected againſt the Antiquity of this Tradition, is certainly very erroneous; for 'tis ſo far from being firſt known to the World, at the publication of <hi>Geoffrey</hi>'s Hiſtory, that <hi>Nennius,</hi> long before that time, and <hi>Merlyn,</hi> much antienter then he, ſpeak of the <hi>Britains</hi> being deſcended from <hi>Troy.</hi> Nay the <hi>Saxons</hi> themſelves before <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> were not unacquainted with this Tradition, as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears, from the antient <hi>Saxon</hi> Poet, mention'd by Mr. <hi>Wheelock,</hi> whom he thus tranſlates;<note place="margin">Notes on <hi>Bede.</hi>

            <p>But admitting the <hi>Grecians</hi> to have been ignorant of any ſuch Place as <hi>Britain,</hi> and that there never
<pb facs="tcp:58558:19"/> was, any Traffic or Communication betwixt theſe two Nations; yet ſince the <hi>Gauls</hi> ſpoke <hi>Greek,</hi> it is not very improbable but that the <hi>Britains</hi> might borrow from them. That the <hi>Gauls</hi> uſed the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue, we have the Teſtimony of <hi>Cæſar;</hi> and it is very certain, that all the <hi>Grecian</hi> Learning flouriſhed at <hi>Marſeils,</hi> which was an antient and famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, and is very much celebrated by all almoſt, both <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Writers. And by this means, it may be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably concluded, how the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>Gauliſh Druids</hi> became acquainted with the <hi>Grecian</hi> Philoſophy, which being as to all the different Sects and Opinions of it, taught at <hi>Marſeils,</hi> the <hi>Druids</hi> more particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered to the <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> to which the <hi>Druid</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy hears a very near reſemblance, both as to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>But in oppoſition to this, it may be with greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty urged, that neither the <hi>Gauliſh</hi> nor <hi>Britiſh Druids</hi> had any Correſpondence with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and conſequently could not borrow their Philoſophical Myſteries from them. For if <hi>Cæſar</hi> may be believed, <hi>The Art and Learning of the</hi> Druids <hi>was firſt found out in</hi> Britain,<note place="margin">Lib. VI.</note> 
               <hi>and from thence is thought to be brought into</hi> Gaul; <hi>and at this time,</hi> as he goes on, <hi>ſuch as will attain to the perfect knowledge of that Diſcipline, do for the moſt part tra<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g, and that the <hi>Gauls</hi> came over hither to be inſtructed in the Way and Method of it; I can ſee no reaſon, why they ſhould have any communication with the <hi>Grecian</hi> Academy at <hi>Marſeils,</hi> much leſs that they borrowed it from the Diſciples of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> eſpecially ſince they accounted their Myſteries ſo Sacred, that they would communicate them to none, beſides thoſe of their own Order. Nay, it may be better queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:58558:20"/> 
               <hi>Diuidiſm</hi> be not much <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntienter than <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and antecedent to that <hi>Aera,</hi> when the <hi>Grecians</hi> began to Philoſophize. And for the ſame reaſon, that the <hi>Druids</hi> of <hi>Britain</hi> did not derive their Philoſophy from <hi>Marſeils,</hi> it will follow, that they could not borrow their Language; for if we ſuppoſe, which is the moſt we can, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> had ſome communication with thoſe <hi>Grecians,</hi> and upon that account that their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was in ſome meaſure mingled with the <hi>Greek;</hi> yet in their travel to <hi>Britain,</hi> they came not to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, but to borrow; and 'tis not likely that the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> ſhould be affected with the Language of thoſe who came to learn of them. Beſides, of all the number of <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Words collected by <hi>Cambden,</hi> which agree with the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> few or none ſeem to be of <hi>Greek</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation; ſo it is highly improbable, as for as we can ſee into this Matter, that the <hi>Gauls</hi> ſhould ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the <hi>Greek</hi> Tongue to the <hi>Britains.</hi> And therefore, ſince this difficulty cannot be removed by any other way, it is not unreaſonable to ſuſpect, that there is ſome real Foundation lodged in the Ruins of the Story of <hi>Brutus,</hi> and that the Truth is disfigured by the boundleſs acceſſion of Poetical Invention.</p>
            <p>I ſhould tire the Reader, and exceed the juſt bounds of what I at firſt propoſed, if I ſhould take a particular view of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory publiſhed by <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> and therefore I ſhall now only take notice of the Life of King <hi>Cadwalader,</hi> where the Hiſtory of <hi>Wales</hi> begins, and where a palpable Miſtake, I may call it Forgery, has been committed by one ſide or another. For the very ſame things, which the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory relate of <hi>Cadwalader,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Writers attribute to <hi>Ceadwalla</hi> King of the Weſt <hi>Saxons,</hi> how he was driven by a Famine out of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, came afterwards to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was received by Pope <hi>Sergius,</hi> with other particulars too tedious here to relate. But that which ſeems to charge the Fault upon <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> or whoever elſe was the Author of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory, is, that <hi>Bede</hi> an Author of eſtabliſhed Credit,
<pb facs="tcp:58558:20"/> and one who lived near thoſe times, ſays that it was the Weſt <hi>Saxon</hi> King <hi>Ceadwalla</hi> that went to <hi>Rome</hi> in Pope <hi>Sergius</hi>'s time. But then on the other ſide, it is hardly conceivable, ſuppoſing the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory a perfect Contrivance, that <hi>Geoffrey</hi> or any other ſhould be ſo groſly over ſeen, as to borrow the Tranſaction of a real King, and one ſo well known, to make up the Life of a fictitious one cotemporary with him. <hi>Bede</hi>'s Reputation was too firm, to be ſhaken by an upſtart Hiſtory, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot well be ſuppoſed that the Author of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory was ſo unwary, in caſe he deſigned a Cheat, as to let himſelf open to ſo eaſy a detection of Forgery. All then that can be ſaid, is, that the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the Names and time that theſe two Princes lived in, and poſſibly their both going to <hi>Rome,</hi> which was not unuſual in thoſe days, might without any deſign of putting upon the World, make a confuſion in their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. But whether the Life of <hi>Cadwalader</hi> be a Fable, the Reader is at his own liberty to judge; it being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to the Hiſtory of <hi>Wales,</hi> not as it is more Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, or any way of greater certainty than the reſt of <hi>Geof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey</hi>'s Hiſtory, but only becauſe the Author <hi>Caradoc</hi> of <hi>Lhangarfan,</hi> began his continuace of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtory with it.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Caradoo</hi> of <hi>Lhangaifan,</hi> an Author of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Integrity, was cotemporary with <hi>Geoffrey,</hi> who taking his riſe from the place where the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory concluded, made a continuation of it thro' the Reigns of ſeveral of the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> till the Year <hi>1157.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which time he flouriſhed. After him, all things of moment that happened in <hi>Wales,</hi> were kept and recorded in the Abbies of <hi>Conwey</hi> in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and <hi>Yſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flur</hi> in <hi>South-Wales,</hi> where the Princes and Noblemen of <hi>Wales</hi> were buried, as appears by the Teſtimony of <hi>Gutryn Owen,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Edward IV.</hi> and writ the moſt exact and perfect Copy of the ſame. All the moſt notable Occurrences being thus Regiſtred in theſe Abbies, were moſt generally compared together every third
<pb facs="tcp:58558:21"/> Year, when the <hi>Beirdh</hi> or <hi>Bards</hi> belonging to theſe two Houſes went their ordinary Viſitations, which was called <hi>Clera.</hi> And this continued until the Year <hi>1270.</hi> a little before the Death of the laſt Prince <hi>Lhewelyn,</hi> who was ſlain at <hi>Buelht. Humphrey Lloyd</hi> Gent. who flouriſhed in the Reign of <hi>Henry VIII.</hi> and one greatly skill'd in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, continued this Hiſtory to the Death of Prince <hi>Lhewelyn;</hi> and afterwards having tranſlated the whole into <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, had deſigned to commit it to the Preſs. But his Death prevented what he purpoſed, and ſtopped the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Hiſtory for a long time after, until <hi>David Powel</hi> D. D. in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> having met with <hi>Humphrey Lloyd</hi>'s Tranſtation, collected what he could out of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians, which he added by way of Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo publiſhed it in the Year <hi>1584.</hi> This being the ſole Hiſtory of the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the only Edition of this Hiſtory, I was moved to prepare it for another Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion by a new modelling the Language, making the Body of the Hiſtory intire, without troubling the Reader to ſee the ſame thing by way of Annotation, Dr. <hi>Powel</hi>'s Notes being for the greateſt part but a repetition of the ſame matter of Fact out of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtorians, with what other Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could be made. The Additions which I made to the former Hiſtory, I chiefly, took out of the Notes of that late great Antiquarian Mr. <hi>Robert Vaughan</hi> of <hi>Hengwrt;</hi> by whoſe help alſo I have corrected, ſupplyed and continued the Chronology. Sir <hi>John Price</hi>'s Deſcription of <hi>Wales</hi> will pretty well anſwer the Geographical part of this Hiſtory, til we ſhall be able to recover and fix ſeveral of thoſe places whoſe <hi>Names</hi> are only left to us at preſent, which we have great hopes, will be ſucceſsfully perfected, by the unwearied Labours of my ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Edward Lhwyd,</hi> in his intended Etymological Dictionary. I have added by way of Appendix, the ſeveral Records belonging to this Hiſtory, and choſe rather to inſert the Articles of Peace betwixt Prince <hi>Lhewelyn,</hi> and <hi>John Peckam</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> in the Original, with reference thereunto, than to inſert all the Grievances which the <hi>Welch</hi> then made in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Languge, which do not ſo bandſomly bear a Tranſlation.</p>

            <p>And becauſe the Name of this Country is changed, or rather miſtaken by the Inhabitants of <hi>England,</hi> and not by them called <hi>Cambry,</hi> but <hi>Wales:</hi> I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to declare the occaſion thereof, which is, that where the <hi>Saxons</hi> a People of <hi>Germany</hi> were the firſt that after the <hi>Britains</hi> inhabited and ruled the greateſt part of this Iſle, and drove the <hi>Britains</hi> to that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, which according to the manner of their Country they called <hi>Wales,</hi> and the People <hi>Welch-men,</hi> and the Tongue <hi>Welch,</hi> that is to ſay, Strange, or not of them underſtood. For at this Day the Inhabitants of the <hi>Low Countries</hi> call their next Neighbours Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Henegaw,</hi> or other that ſpeak <hi>French, Walſh,</hi> as a Language to them unknown. Likewiſe the dwellers of <hi>Tyroll</hi> and other the higher Countries of <hi>Germany</hi> do Name the <hi>Italian</hi> their next Neighbour a <hi>Welch-man,</hi> and his Language <hi>Walſh.</hi> And this is an evident Proof, that they which harped upon a Queen <hi>Gwalaes,</hi> and of a Prince <hi>Wala</hi> (of whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Britiſh, Latin,</hi> nor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) were foully deceived; and ſo likewiſe was a great Hiſtoriographer of late Days, which ſaith, that it was called <hi>Wallia, quaſi Italia,</hi> becauſe the reſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> which remained in the Iſle were driven thither.

            <head>THE HISTORY OF WALES.</head>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, under <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian the Younger,</hi> began to decline, and became ſenſibly unable to repreſs the perpetual Incurſions of the <hi>Goths, Huns, Vandals,</hi> and other barbarous Invaders; it was found neceſſary to abandon the remoteſt Parts of that unwieldy Body, and to recal the <hi>Roman</hi> Forces that defended them, the better to ſecure the Inward, and the Provinces moſt expoſed to the Depredations of the <hi>Barbarians.</hi> And in this Exigency of the <hi>Roman</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, <hi>Britain,</hi> as lying far remote from the Heart of the Empire, was deprived of the <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſons; which, being tranſported into <hi>Gaul</hi> upon more urgent Occaſions, left it naked and expoſed to the inveterate Cruelty of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts:</hi> for no ſooner had they underſtood of the <hi>Romans</hi> Departure out of <hi>Britain,</hi> and that the <hi>Britains</hi> were to expect no further Help from the Empire; but they deſcend in greater Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than formerly, and with greater Courage and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, being how rid of the Fear they entertained of the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions, who always uſed to hinder their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:58558:34"/> Progreſs, and to prevent their Incurſions into the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Province. The <hi>Britains</hi> perceiving their antient and implacable Enemies to fall upon them, and finding themſelves far too weak to repel their Endleſs Deva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations; with a lamentable Narrative of their own Miſeries, and the cruel Oppreſſions of their Enemies, they ſent over to <hi>Gaul,</hi> imploring Aid of <hi>Aetius</hi> Praefect of that Province; who, being moved with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Condition of the <hi>Britains,</hi> diſpatch'd over a Legion under the Command of <hi>Gallio,</hi> which unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly ſurpriſing the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> forced them, with great Loſs and Deſtruction, to retire over the Seas or Friths to their own Habitations. Then helping then to build a Wall of Stone croſs the Land, for a Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark againſt any future Irruptions; the <hi>Romans,</hi> at their Departure, told them, they could not any more undertake ſuch dangerous Expeditions for their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and therefore admoniſhed them to take Arms and like Men vindicate their Country, their Wives Children and Liberties from the Injuries of their bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Enemies.</p>

            <p>The Reaſon that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation was at this time ſo weak and impotent, and ſo manifeſtly unable to withſtand theſe barbarous Enemies, who were far inferiour as to extent of Countrey, and probably in number of People, may in great meaſure be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Eaſe and Quietneſs the <hi>Britains</hi> enjoy'd under the <hi>Roman</hi> Government. For whilſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Legions continued in <hi>Britain,</hi> they ever undertook the Security and Preſervation of it; ſo that the <hi>Britains</hi> heretofore were little concerned at the Incurſions of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> depending wholly upon the Strength and Valour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> inſomuch, that within a while, they fell into a fit of Luxury and Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminacy, and quickly forgot that Martial Prowneſs, and Military Conduct which their Anceſtors ſo Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly excelled in. For after their intire Subjection to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they had little or no Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to Experience their Valour, excepting in ſome home-bred Commotions, excited by the aſpiring Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of ſome <hi>male</hi>-contented General, which were quickly compos'd and reduced to nothing. And after the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> grew Formidable, and durſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to make Incurſions into the <hi>Roman</hi> Province, the <hi>Britains</hi> were the leaſt concerned in Oppoſing them, leaving that to the Care and Vigilancy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſons. And this Eaſineſs and Supinity of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> may not be untruly attributed to the Policy of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conſtitution: For when the <hi>Britains</hi> were brought ſubject to the Empire, the firſt thing the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> effected towards the Confirmation of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, was to take the Sword out of their Hands. They were ſenſible how Bold and Valorous the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> naturally were, how <hi>unlike</hi> to ſubmit their Necks to a Foreign Yoke, and therefore they found it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable to obtain a quiet Poſſeſſion of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as long as the <hi>Britains</hi> had Power and Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to Oppoſe them. This Courſe they found very effectual, and when they had once lulled them aſleep, they were not over ſolicitous to rouſe and awaken them.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:58558:35"/>
            <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> alſo might poſſibly be too much taken with this ſedentary and unactive Life; and as long as they lived Secure under the Protection of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, they little feared their Countrey would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Prey to any barbarous Nation. No one would have imagined that that Glorious Empire would be ſo ſoon cruſhed to pieces, which could not otherwiſe be effected, than by the inſupportable preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of its own Weight. This apprehenſion of the Greatneſs and Strength of the <hi>Romans,</hi> made the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> probably leſs ſolicitous of enabling themſelves to Defend their Countrey, not thinking they would ever forſake and relinquiſh the Province of <hi>Britain.</hi> But to their Sorrow they experienc'd the contrary, the Affairs of the Empire elſewhere requiring the Help of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Legions, ſo that they were left expoſed to the Cruelties of the <hi>Northern</hi> Invaders, having not as yet recovered any Power or Conduct to oppoſe them. For had not the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> come on ſo forcibly at firſt, but had given time to the <hi>Britains</hi> to ſhake off that Lethargy they had for many Years been bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in, and to renew their Antient Diſcipline and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, there had been no need of calling in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> ſeeing they would in all probability been able to Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their Ground againſt any Oppoſition, and likely had been in Poſſeſſion of their whole Countrey to this time. But next to the Decree of Heaven, the Ruin of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation muſt be attributed to its too much Luxury and Effeminacy, and to the univerſal Lapſe of the Nobility and People into an averſion of an Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Action and Martial Diſcipline. For tho' a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Peace be in it ſelf deſirable, yet oftentimes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing tends more to the future Ruin and Downfal of a Nation. For Peace begets in Men generally a habit of Looſeneſs and Debauchery, is the occaſion of many notorious Extravagancies and vitious Practiſes, which weakens their Hands, and cools their Courage and Greatneſs of Mind, ſo that in caſe of any open Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they are uncapable to Defend their Countrey, and unfit to Oppoſe the Common Enemy. Scarce any Kingdom or Nation was ſubverted, but the Ruin of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58558:35"/> it was uſher'd in by theſe means; witneſs the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrian</hi> under <hi>Sardanapalus,</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> under <hi>Darius,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> under <hi>Cleopatra;</hi> ſo that it was moſt prudently urged by a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator, that <hi>Carthage</hi> might not be demoliſhed, leſt that for want of an Enemy abroad, the Valour of the <hi>Romans</hi> might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, and their Conduct be forgotten. Had the <hi>Britains</hi> had the Fortune to be continually in action, and not exchanged their Courage and Diſcipline for Eaſe and Lazineſs, they had had no reaſon to dread the Incurſions of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> nor any need of the Aid and Aſſiſtance of a foreign Nation; but the condition of their Affairs then required it, and Help muſt be had, or elſe their Countrey muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably become a Prey to thoſe Northern Invaders.</p>
            <p>To prevent therefore and repel their Violence, King <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This Meſſage of the <hi>Britains,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever originally delivered, is by an antient <hi>Saxon</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter repeated in this manner; <hi>Most noble</hi> Saxons, <hi>the miſerable</hi> Britains, <hi>ſhatter'd and quite worn out by the frequent Incurſions of their Enemies, upon the news of your many ſignal Victories, have ſent us to you, humbly requeſting that you would aſſiſt them at this juncture. A Land large and ſpacious, abounding with all manner of Neceſſaries, they give up entirely to your diſpoſal. Hitherto we have lived happily under the Government and Protection of the</hi> Romans; <hi>next to the</hi> Romans <hi>we know none of greater Valour than your ſelves, and therefore in your Arms do now ſeek refuge. Let but that Courage and thoſe Arms make us Conquerors, and we ſhall refuſe no Service you ſhall pleaſe to impoſe.</hi> To this Meſſage the <hi>Saxons</hi> returned this ſhort An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: <hi>Aſſure your ſelves, the</hi> Saxons <hi>will be true Friends to the</hi> Britains, <hi>and as ſuch, ſhall be always ready both to relieve their Neceſſities, and to advance their Intereſt.</hi>

            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:58558:36"/>
            <p>The <hi>Saxons</hi> being thus happily courted to what themſelves had a thouſand times wiſh'd for, arriv'd ſoon after in <hi>Britain,</hi> in three Gallies, called in their own Language <hi>Kiules,</hi> under the Conduct of two Brethren <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and <hi>Horſa.</hi> Being honourably received by the King, and affectionately treated by the People, <hi>their Faith</hi> was given of both ſides; the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulating to defend the <hi>Britains</hi> Countrey, and the <hi>Britains</hi> to give the <hi>Saxons</hi> a ſatisfactory Reward for all the Pains and Dangers they ſhould undergo upon their account. At firſt the <hi>Saxons</hi> ſhewed themſelves very diligent in their Employment, and ſucceſsfully repell'd the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> who being probably igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the landing of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and fearing no oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, boldly advanc'd to the Heart of the Countrey. But when the <hi>Saxons</hi> became better acquainted with the Iſland, and happily diſcovered the Weakneſs and Inability of the <hi>Britains;</hi> under pretence that their Pay was not anſwerable to their Service and Deſerts, they quarrelled with the <hi>Britains,</hi> and inſtead of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting them according to Oath, entered into a League with their Enemies the <hi>Scots.</hi> Moreover, <hi>Hengiſt</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving with whom he had to do, ſent over to acquaint his Countreymen with the Beauty and Fertility of the Iſland, the Infirmity and Effeminacy of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants; inviting them to be Sharers of his future Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Expectations. To his Invitation they readily comply, and ſailing over in great Numbers, they thought to take poſſeſſion of that Countrey, which Fortune promiſed ſhould be their own: But they muſt fight for it firſt; the <hi>Britains</hi> being reſolved to the laſt to defend themſelves and their Country againſt theſe treacherous Practices of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> and if poſſible, to drive them to their primitive Habitations.

For ſome time they continued peaceably in this part of <hi>Wales;</hi> but <hi>Eadred</hi> Duke of <hi>Mercia,</hi> called by the <hi>Welch Edryd Wallthîr,</hi> not being able any longer to bear ſuch an ignominious ejection, made great Preparations for the re-gaining of the ſaid Countrey.

But like ill Weeds, the more you root them, the faſter they will grow; the <hi>Danes</hi> were ſtill ſupplied from abroad, and if an Army was vanquiſhed here, another was ſure to come in their room.

To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of Lent, he choſe out of that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Twelve of the wiſeſt and graveſt, and Perſons of the greateſt Experience, to whom he added <hi>Blegored,</hi> a Man of ſingular Learning, and one exquiſitely ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Laws.

                  <hi>IAgo ap Edwal</hi> being killed, <hi>Gruffydh ap Lhewelyn</hi> was received with loud Acclamations, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſaluted Prince of <hi>North-Wales;</hi> who treading in his Father's ſteps, behaved himſelf in his Government with that Prudence and Conduct, that he manfully defended his Country from the frequent Invaſions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Danes:</hi> For he was ſcarce ſettled in his Throne, when theſe inveterate Enemies of the <hi>Welch</hi> entered in an hoſtile manner into <hi>Wales,</hi> and advanced as far as <hi>Crosford</hi> upon the <hi>Severn,</hi> where <hi>Gruffydh</hi> met them, and forced them ſhamefully to fly,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:58558:77"/> and retire back to their own Country. From thence <hi>Gruffydh</hi> paſſed to <hi>Lhanbadarn Vawr</hi> in <hi>Cardiganſhire,</hi> which he laid in Aſhes; and afterwards marched through all the Country of <hi>South Wales,</hi> receiving of the People Oaths of Fidelity and Subjection to him. In the mean time, <hi>Howel ap Edwyn</hi> Prince of <hi>South-Wales</hi> fled to <hi>Edwyn</hi> Brother to <hi>Leofric</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and prevailed with him to come with an Army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> to his aid againſt <hi>Gruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fydh,</hi> who meeting his Enemies in the Field, eaſily overcame them, <hi>Edwyn</hi> being ſlain upon the ſpot, and <hi>Howel</hi> forced to preſerve his Life by flight. After which Victory, <hi>Gruffydh</hi> having reduced all the Country of <hi>Wales</hi> to ſubjection, returned again to <hi>North Wales.</hi> But <hi>Howel</hi> as ſoon as he could recover himſelf, and <label type="milestone">

               <p>The ſame time <hi>Harold</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> died, and was ſucceeded by his Brother <hi>Hardycnute,</hi> a Prince very famous for Hoſpitality, and a great lover of good Chear, having his Table covered four times a day, with great plenty and variety of Diſhes, with other Superfluities for all Comers.

This Meſſage by no means pleaſed Earl <hi>Godwyn,</hi> a Man of great ſway now in <hi>England;</hi> who knowing <hi>Alfred</hi> to be a perſon of

But ſeeing this was not ſufficient, they acted the ſame part over again, and tythed them the ſecond time; and being highly enraged againſt the <hi>Normans,</hi> they lead <hi>Alfred,</hi> who had brought them over, from <hi>Gilford,</hi> where this Execution was committed, to <hi>Gillingham,</hi> where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put out his Eyes, they removed him to <hi>Ely,</hi> and there at length pitifully murthered him.

Both Armies being joyned, <hi>Gruffydh</hi> eaſily overcame, and purſued <hi>Howel</hi> as far as the Spring-Head of the River <hi>Towy,</hi> where after a long and a bloody Fight, <hi>Howel</hi> was at laſt ſlain, and his Army ſo univerſally routed, that few eſcaped with their Lives.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58558:79"/> ap Ieſtyn</hi> put in their claim to <hi>South-Wales</hi> in right of their Father, who had once enjoyed the Sovereignty of that Country. And in order to the recovery of the ſame, they drew together a great Army, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partly of Strangers and partly of ſuch as they could raiſe in <hi>Gwentland</hi> and <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> and marched to fight with <hi>Gruffydh.</hi> The Prince according to his uſual manner detracted no time, but animating and ſolacing his Soldiers with the remembrance of their former Victories and Conqueſts, bid the Enemies bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which proved ſo very bloody and terrible, that nothing could part them beſide the darkneſs of the Night. This Battel ſo tired and tamed both Armies, that neither was very deſirous of another Engagement, and ſo one being unwilling to ſet upon the other, they both agreed to return to their own Habitations. The ſame time <hi>Joſeph</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Teilo</hi> or <hi>Llandaf</hi> died at <hi>Rome.</hi> But both Armies being ſeparated, Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi> enjoyed a quiet and unmoleſted Poſſeſſion of all <hi>Wales</hi> for about Two Years; after which, the Gentry of <hi>Yſtrad Towy</hi> treacherouſly ſlew 140 of the choice of his Army, which he took in ſo high an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, that to revenge their death he deſtroyed all <hi>Dyfed</hi> and <hi>Yſtrad Towy.</hi>

The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was thus, <hi>Neſt</hi> happening to fall in admiration of a certain Knight, with whom ſhe had more than ordinary Familiarity, even beyond what ſhe expreſt to her own Husband; <hi>Mahael</hi> perceiving her diſſolute
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:58558:94"/> and looſe Behaviour, counſelled her to take care of her Fame and Reputation, and to leave off that ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Liberty which ſhe took; and afterwards meeting caſually her Gallant coming from her, fought and grievouſly wounded him. Upon this, <hi>Neſt</hi> to be revenged upon her Son, went to <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt King of <hi>England,</hi> and in his preſence took her corporal Oath, that her Son <hi>Mahael</hi> was illegiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and not begot by <hi>Barnard Newmarch</hi> her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, but another Perſon; by virtue of which Oath, or rather Perjury, <hi>Mahael</hi> was diſinherited, and his Siſter, whom her Mother atteſted to be legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, was beſtowed by the King upon <hi>Milo,</hi> the Son of <hi>Walter Conſtable,</hi> afterward Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> who in right of his Wife enjoyed the whole eſtate of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard Newmarch</hi> Lord of <hi>Brecnock.</hi> Of this <hi>Milo</hi> it is reported, that telling King <hi>Henry</hi> of a ſtrange Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which had occurred to him by <hi>Lhyn Savathan</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> where the Birds upon the Pond at the paſſing by of <hi>Gruffydh</hi> the Son of <hi>Rhys ap Theodor,</hi> ſeemed by their chirping to be in a manner overjoy'd; The King replyed, It was not ſo wonderful; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, ſays he, we have violently and injuriouſly oppreſſed that Nation, yet it is manifeſtly known, that they are the lawful and original Inheritors of that Country.</p>
               <p>But whilſt the <hi>Normans</hi> were thus carving for themſelves in <hi>Glamorgan</hi> and <hi>Brecnock, Cadogan ap Blethyn ap Confyn</hi> towards the end of <hi>April,</hi> entered into <hi>Dyved,</hi> and having ravaged and deſtroyed the Country, returned back.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:58558:94"/> thought they might as well expect the like fortune. Wherefore having obtained a Grant from King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> (who readily conſented to their Requeſt, becauſe by this means he killed two Birds with one Stone, procured to himſelf their utmoſt Service upon occaſion, and withal provided for them without any Charge to himſelf) they came to <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſo entered upon the Eſtates appointed them by the King, which they held of him by Knight-ſervice, having firſt done Homage and ſworn Fealty for the ſame. <hi>Roger Montgomery</hi> Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> did Homage for the Lordſhips of <hi>Powis</hi> and <hi>Card gan; Hugh Lupus</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> for <hi>Tegengl</hi> and <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Roger Montgomery,</hi> who by the Conquerour was created Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> entered in an hoſtile manner into <hi>Powys-land,</hi> and having won the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Baldwyn,</hi> fortified it in his own right, and called it <hi>Montgomery</hi> after his own Name.

But the Plot was laid deeper; and when without any ſuſpicion of Treachery he made his appearance, he was ſurprizedly attainted of High-Treaſon, and then contrary to all Right and Juſtice actually condemn'd to perpetual Impriſonment; the true reaſon of this unparallel'd Severity being, the King feared his Strength, and was apprehenſive that he would revenge the Wrong and Affront he received at his hands. And indeed, well had he reaſon to fear that, when he ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully treated him, whoſe Service he had experienced to be ſo greatly advantagious to him. But the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of Princes is unaccountable; and whether to value an eminent Perſon for his Service, or to fear him for his Greatneſs, is a Subject that frequently diſturbs their moſt ſettled Conſiderations. But the Noblemen that were at this time ſent by the King to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> were <hi>Richard de Belmerſh,</hi> who being chief Agent about <hi>Roger Montgomery</hi> Earl of <hi>Salop,</hi> was preferred to the Biſhoprick of <hi>London,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appointed by this King, to be Warden of the Marches, and Governour of the County of <hi>Salop.</hi> With him were joyned in company, <hi>Walter Conſtable,</hi> the Father of <hi>Milo,</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Rayner</hi> the King's Lieutenant in the County of <hi>Salop.</hi> About this time, as <hi>Bale</hi> writes, the Church of <hi>Menevia</hi> or S. <hi>Davids,</hi> began to be ſubject to the See of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> being always afore the Metropolitan Church of all <hi>Wales.</hi>

The ſame time King <hi>Henry</hi> took away from <hi>Saer</hi> the Government of <hi>Dyfed,</hi> which formerly was <hi>Iorwerth ap Blethyn</hi>'s, and beſtowed it upon <hi>Gerald,</hi> who had been ſome time Earl <hi>Arnulph</hi>'s Steward in thoſe Parts; and therefore by reaſon of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Country, was in all probability beſt able to take upon him the Management of it. But the <hi>Normans</hi> in <hi>Rydcors</hi> Caſtle being ſenſible that they were not able to effect any thing againſt <hi>Howel ap Grono</hi> in open Field, after their accuſtomed manner, began to put that in execution by Treachery, which they could not compaſs by force of Arms. And how to make <hi>Howel</hi> a Sacrifice to thoſe <hi>Normans</hi> he had lately ſlain, they could find no ſafer way than by corrupting one <hi>Gwgan ap Meyric,</hi> a Man in great Favour and Eſteem with <hi>Howel,</hi> upon the account chiefly that one of his Children was nurſed by <hi>Gwgan</hi>'s
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:58558:100"/> Wife. This ungrateful Villain, to carry on his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Intrigue the more unſuſpected, gave <hi>Howel</hi> a very earneſt invitation to his Houſe to a Merriment, where, without any ſuſpicion of Treachery, being come, he was welcomed with all the ſeeming Affection and Kindneſs imaginable.

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">A.D. </seg>1103</label> but <hi>Gwgan</hi> gave notice thereof to the <hi>Norman</hi> Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and therefore by break of day they entered the Town, and coming about the Houſe where <hi>Howel</hi> lay in Bed, they preſently gave a great ſhout. <hi>Howel</hi> hearing the noiſe, ſuſpected ſomething of Miſchief, and therefore leaping in all haſte out of Bed, he made to his Weapons, but could not find them, by reaſon that <hi>Gwgan</hi> had conveyed them away whilſt he was aſleep. And now being aſſured of Treachery in the caſe, and finding that his Men had fled for their Lives, he endeavour'd all he could to make his eſcape; but <hi>Gwgan</hi> and his Company were too quick for him; and ſo being ſecured, they ſtrangled him, and deliver'd his Body to the <hi>Normans,</hi> who having cut off his Head, convey'd it to the Caſtle of <hi>Rydcors.</hi> This moſt villainous Murther, ſo barbarouſly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the King's Lieutenant, was not in the leaſt taken notice of; for King <hi>Henry</hi> was ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prejudiced in favour of the <hi>Normans,</hi> that whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Miſdemeanour, be it of never ſo high a nature, was by them committed, it was preſently winked at, and let fall to the ground; whereas, if the <hi>Welch</hi> treſpaſſed but againſt the leaſt injunction of the King's Laws, they were moſt ſeverely puniſhed: which was the cauſe that they afterwards ſtood up againſt the King in their own defence, being by experience aſſured, that he minded nothing more than their utter Deſtruction.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Anſelm,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> convened a Synod at <hi>London,</hi> wherein among other Injunctions then decreed, the Celibacy of the Clergy was enjoyned; Marriage being before ever allowed of in <hi>Britain,</hi> to them in Holy Orders.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:58558:101"/> as reaſonable and orthodoxical; others condemning it, as an innovation, and contrary to the plain Letter of Scripture.

But when neither Father nor Son could be found, all the fault was laid upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>chtryd,</hi> who had diſſuaded them from falling upon the Caſtle unexpectedly; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all they could do, ſince their eſcape, was to burn and deſtroy the Country; which they did effectually, excepting the two Sanctuaries of <hi>Lhanpadarn</hi> and <hi>Lhandewi Brefi;</hi> out of which however they took ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons who had eſcaped thither, and carried them away Priſoners to their ſeveral Countries. But <hi>Owen,</hi> with them who were acceſſary to the burning of <hi>Rydcors</hi> Caſtle, being fled into <hi>Ireland,</hi> deſired the Umbrage and Protection of King <hi>Murcart;</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him very gladly, upon the account of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer acquaintance; for <hi>Owen,</hi> during the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and the <hi>Welch,</hi> had fled to King <hi>Murcart,</hi> and brought him very rich Preſents from <hi>Wales. Cadwgan</hi> all this while lay pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately in <hi>Powys;</hi> but thinking it impoſſible to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue there long undiſcovered, he adjudged it his wiſer way to ſend to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and to declare his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and Abhorrence of that Fact which his Son had
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:58558:103"/> committed. The King was eaſily perſuaded that the old Man was guiltleſs, and wholly ignorant of his Son's Crime; and therefore he gave him permiſſion to remain in the Country, and to enjoy the Town and Lands he received by his Wife, who was the Daughter of a <hi>Norman</hi> Lord, called <hi>Pygot de Say.</hi> But his Lands in <hi>Powys</hi> were otherwiſe diſtributed; for his Nephews <hi>Madoc</hi> and <hi>Ithel,</hi> finding what Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances their Uncle <hi>Cadwgan</hi> lay under, upon the account of his Son <hi>Owen;</hi> they divided betwixt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſuch Lands as he and his Son poſſeſſed in <hi>Powys,</hi> though afterwards they could never agree about the equal diſtribution of it. To counter-ballance this, <hi>Cadwgan</hi> made ſuch Friends to the King of <hi>England,</hi> that upon paying the Fine of 100 <hi>l.</hi> he had a grant of all his Lands in <hi>Cardigan,</hi> and a power to recall all the Inhabitants, who had rubb'd off upon the publication of the King's late Order, That no <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> or <hi>Norman</hi> ſhould dwell in <hi>Cardigan.</hi> Upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of this grant to <hi>Cadwgan,</hi> ſeveral of them that retired to <hi>Ireland</hi> returned again privately to <hi>Wales,</hi> and lurkingly remained with their Friends; but <hi>Owen</hi> durſt not appear in <hi>Cardigan,</hi> by reaſon that his Father had received that Country from King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> upon condition that he would never entertain or receive his Son, nor by any means ſuccour him either with Men or Money. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Owen</hi> came to <hi>Powys,</hi> and would fain be reconciled to the King, and make an Attonement for his late Miſdemeanour; but he could find no body that would venture to ſpeak in his behalf, nor make the King acquainted with his deſire and willingneſs, to ſubmit. And thus being hopeleſs and full of Deſpair, he could not poſſibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine which way to turn himſelf; till at laſt, a very unexpected opportunity offered him means and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to oppoſe the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The matter was this, there happened a Difference betwixt <hi>Madoc ap R<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

The firſt thing he did, was the beſt he could to ſecure himſelf in this new-purchaſed Inheritance; in order to which, he erected two Caſtles, one upon the Frontiers of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> upon the Mouth of the River <hi>Yſtwyth,</hi> a Mile diſtant from <hi>Lhanbadarn;</hi> the other towards <hi>Dyfed,</hi> upon the River <hi>Teifi,</hi> at a place called <hi>Dyngerant;</hi> where, as ſome think, <hi>Roger Montgomery</hi> had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before laid the Foundation of <hi>Cilgarran</hi> Caſtle. <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>Madawc</hi> were all this while in <hi>Ireland;</hi> but this latter being at length tired with the Country, and not willing to endure the Manners and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> came over for <hi>Wales,</hi> and paſſed to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of his Uncle <hi>Iorwerth.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:58558:105"/> that <hi>Iorwerth</hi> lay one night at <hi>Caereineon,</hi> gathered all their ſtrength, and came and encompaſſed the Houſe at Midnight; which when <hi>Iorwerth</hi>'s Servants perceived, they aroſe and defended the Houſe with all the Might they could; but the Aſſailants at laſt putting the Houſe on fire, they were glad, as many as could, to eſcape through the Flames; the greateſt part being forced to yield, either to the Enemies Sword, or the more conquering Fire. <hi>Iorwerth</hi> ſeeing no remedy, but that he muſt undergo the ſame Fate as his Men had done, choſe rather to dye in the preſence of his Enemies, with his Sword in his Hand, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his Life to the cowardly Flames; and therefore ruſhing out with great Violence, he was received up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the points of the Enemies Spears, and ſo being toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into the Fire, he miſerably periſhed by a double death. As ſoon as King <hi>Henry</hi> heard of his Death, he ſent for <hi>Cadwgan</hi> to him, and gave him all his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Eſtate, being <hi>Powys-land;</hi> and promiſing his Son <hi>Owen</hi> his Pardon, upon condition he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean himſelf quietly and loyally hereafter, willed him to ſend for him back from <hi>Ireland.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> alſo about this time, married his natural Son <hi>Robert</hi> to <hi>Mabil</hi> Daughter and ſole Heir to <hi>Robert Fiz-hamon</hi> Lord of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> in whoſe Right this <hi>Robert</hi> became Lord of <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> being before by the King created E. of <hi>Gloceſter;</hi> by whom the Caſtle of <hi>Cardaf</hi> was built.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Madawc</hi> finding the matter nothing mended, and that his other Uncle <hi>Cadwgan,</hi> who lay under the ſame Obligation to the King of <hi>England,</hi> ruled the Country, hid himſelf in the moſt private and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceſſible places, watching only an opportunity to commit the like Fact upon <hi>Cadwgan,</hi> and to murder him by one treacherous way or another. And this he effected in a little time; for <hi>Cadwgan</hi> having reduced the Country to ſome ſort of Settlement and Quietneſs, and reſtored the Courts of Judicature, where he ſate in perſon to adminiſter Juſtice; came with the reſt of the Elders of the Country to <hi>Trallwng,</hi> now <hi>Pool;</hi> and having begun to build a Caſtle, he thought to make that the conſtant Seat of his Habitation. <hi>Madawc</hi>

Then he ſent preſently a meſſage to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the King's Lieutenant in the Marches, to put him in mind of his former Promiſes to him, when he chaſed <hi>Owen</hi> out of the Country; becauſe that the Biſhop bearing an inveterate Enmity to <hi>Cadwgan,</hi> and his Son <hi>Owen,</hi> granted <hi>Madawc</hi> ſuch Lands, as his Brother <hi>Ithel</hi> was poſſeſſed of.

Owen</hi> did not ſtay long before he came over; and then going to King <hi>Henry,</hi> he was honourably received, and had all his Fathers Eſtate reſtored to him; whereupon, in gratitude of this ſignal Favour, he voluntarily promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay the King a conſiderable Fine, for the due payment of which, he gave very reſponſible Pledges. <hi>Madawc</hi> finding himſelf alone to be left in the lurch, and that he had no ſeeming Power to bear Head againſt the King, thought it alſo his wiſeſt way to make what Reconciliation he could; and therefore he offered the King a very great Fine, if he ſhould peaceably enjoy his former Eſtate, promiſing withal, never to moleſt or diſturb any one that was ſubject to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> willing to bring all matters to a ſettled condition, readily granted his Requeſt, and conferred upon him all he could reaſonably ask for; only with this Proviſo, that upon his peril he ſhould provide for the Relations of them whom he had ſo baſely murthered.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">A.D. </seg>1111</label> next Year, King <hi>Henry</hi> prepared a mighty Army to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>Wales,</hi> being provoked thereto by the requeſt
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:58558:107"/> of thoſe who enjoyed a great part of the Welchmens Lands, but would not be ſatisfied till they got all. For <hi>Gilbert Strongbow</hi> Earl of <hi>Strygill,</hi> upon whom the King had beſtowed <hi>Cardigan,</hi> made great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of <hi>Owen ap Cadwgan,</hi> declaring how that he received and entertained ſuch Perſons as ſpoiled and robbed in his Country; and <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> made the like of <hi>Gruffydh ap Conan</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> how that his Subjects and the Men of <hi>Grono ap Owen ap Edwyn</hi> Lord of <hi>Tegengl,</hi> unreproved, waſted, and burnt the Country of <hi>Cheſhire;</hi> and to aggravate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the more, he added farther, that <hi>Gruffydh</hi> neither owed any Service, nor paid any Tribute to the King. Upon theſe Complaints, King <hi>Henry</hi> was ſo cruelly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, that he ſwore he would not leave one living Creature remaining in <hi>North-Wales</hi> and <hi>Powys-land;</hi> but having extirpated utterly the preſent Race of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he would plant a Colony of new Inhabitants. And then dividing his Army into three parts, he deliver'd one to the conduct of the Earl of <hi>Strygill,</hi> to go againſt <hi>South-Wales,</hi> which comprehended the whole Power of the fourth part of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Cornwal:</hi> The next Battel was deſigned againſt <hi>North-Wales,</hi> in which was all the ſtrength of <hi>Scotland</hi> and the North, and was commanded by <hi>Alexander</hi> King of the <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter:</hi> the Third the King led him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt <hi>Powys,</hi> wherein was contained the whole ſtrength of the middle part of <hi>England. Meredith ap Blethyn</hi> hearing of theſe mighty Preparations, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed that this vaſt Army was deſign'd againſt <hi>Wales,</hi> was quickly apprehenſive that the <hi>Welch</hi> were not able to make any great Defence; and therefore thought it his ſafeſt way to provide for himſelf before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; and ſo coming to the King, yielded himſelf up to his Mercy. But <hi>Owen</hi> fearing to commit himſelf to thoſe whom he knew ſo greedily to covet his Eſtate, and whom he was aſſured were far more deſirous to diſpoſſeſs the <hi>Welch</hi> of their Lands, than any other way to puniſh them for former Crimes and Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, fled to <hi>Gruffydh ap Conan</hi> to <hi>North-Wales.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, King <hi>Henry</hi> converted his whole Force that
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:58558:107"/> way, and came himſelf as far as <hi>Murcastelh,</hi> and the <hi>Scotch</hi> King to <hi>Pennant Bachwy;</hi> but the People flying to the Mountains, carried with them all the Cattel and Proviſion they had; ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> could not follow them, and as many as attempted to come at them, were either ſlain or wounded in the ſtreights. But <hi>Alexander</hi> King of the <hi>Scots</hi> finding that nothing could poſſibly be effected againſt the <hi>Welch,</hi> as long as they kept the Rocks and Mountains, ſent to Prince <hi>Gruffydh,</hi> adviſing him to ſubmit himſelf to the King, promiſing him all his Intereſt to obtain an honourable Peace. But the Prince was too well acquainted with <hi>Engliſh</hi> Promiſes, and therefore refuſed his Propoſals; and ſo King <hi>Henry</hi> being very unwilling to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing ſomething in this Expedition, ſent to <hi>Owen</hi> to forſake the Prince, who was not able to defend himſelf, but was ready to ſtrike a Peace with the <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> King and the Earl of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> But this cunning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation would not take effect; for <hi>Owen</hi> was for his life as diſtruſtful of King <hi>Henry</hi> as Prince <hi>Gruffydh;</hi> and therefore he would hearken to no Intreaties for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volting from him, who had all this while afforded him Refuge, till at length his Uncle <hi>Meredith,</hi> an old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuating Politician, perſuaded him, with much a do, not to forſake the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Propoſals, who offered him all his Lands without Tribute, in caſe he would come to his ſide; and therefore <hi>Meredith</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him inſtantly to accept of his offer, before Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi> made a Peace with the King, which if it was once done, he would be glad upon any ſcore to purchaſe the King's Mercy. <hi>Owen</hi> being prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by ſuch Arguments, came to the King, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him very gratiouſly, and told him, that becauſe he believed his Promiſe, he would not only perform that, but likewiſe exalt him above any of his Kindred, and grant him his Lands free from any payment of Tribute. Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi> perceiving how that <hi>Owen</hi> had ſubmitted to the King, thought it alſo his wiſeſt way to ſue for Peace; and ſo promiſing the King a great Sum of Money, a Peace was then actually agreed upon, and confirmed; which the King of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:58558:108"/> 
                  <hi>England</hi> was the more ready to conſent to, becauſe he found it impoſſible to do him any hurt, whilſt he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued encamped in that place. Some affirm, that the ſubmiſſion as well of Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi> as <hi>Owen,</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by the Policy of <hi>Meredith ap Blethyn</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> this laſt working with <hi>Gruffydh,</hi> and aſſuring him that <hi>Owen</hi> had made his Peace with the King before any ſuch thing was in agitation, ſo that the Prince yielding ſomewhat to the Earl's Requeſt, if <hi>Owen</hi> had gone contrary to his Oath, which they had mutually taken, not to make any Peace with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> without one anothers Knowledge, ſeemed to incline to a Peace. On the other hand, <hi>Meredith</hi> going in Perſon to his Nephew <hi>Owen,</hi> affirmed for Truth, that the Prince and the Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> were actually agreed, and that the Prince was on his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the King to make his Submiſſion. And in the mean while <hi>Meredith</hi> took eſpecial care that all Meſſengers betwixt the Prince and <hi>Owen</hi> ſhould be intercepted, and by that means <hi>Owen</hi> wilfully ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to the King.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> having thus finiſhed and brought to an end all his Buſineſs in <hi>Wales,</hi> calling <hi>Owen</hi> to him, told him, that in caſe he would go over with him to <hi>Normandy,</hi> and there be faithful to him, he would upon his return confirm all his Promiſes upon him; and ſo <hi>Owen</hi> accepting of the King's Offer, went with him to <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he behaved himſelf ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, that he was made a Knight; and after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">A.D. </seg>1112</label> the Year following, he had all his Lands and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate confirmed unto him. About the ſame time <hi>Griffri</hi> Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids</hi> died, and King <hi>Henry</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſucceed him one <hi>Barnard</hi> a <hi>Norman,</hi> much againſt the Good-will and Inclination of the <hi>Welch,</hi> who before this time were ever uſed to Elect their own Biſhop. And this Year the rumour of <hi>Gruffydh</hi> Son to <hi>Rhys ap Theodore</hi> was ſpread throughout <hi>South-Wales,</hi> who, as the report went, for fear of the King had been from a Child brought up in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and having come over about two Years afore, paſt his time privately among his Relations, particularly
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:58558:108"/> with <hi>Gerald</hi> Steward of <hi>Pembroke</hi> his Brother-in-Law. And now the noiſe of a new Prince being ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, it came at laſt to the Ears of the King of <hi>England,</hi> that a certain Perſon appeared in <hi>Wales,</hi> who pretended to be the Son of <hi>Rhys ap Theodore</hi> late Prince of <hi>South Wales,</hi> and laid Claim to that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality, which was now in the King's Hands. King <hi>Henry</hi> being ſomewhat concerned with ſuch a Report, and fearing leſt that this new Starter ſhould create him ſome greater trouble, he thought to nip him in the bud, and ſent down Orders to apprehend him. But <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> being aware of the Traps laid againſt him, ſent to <hi>Gruffydh ap Conan</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> deſiring his Aſſiſtance, and that he might have Liberty to remain ſafe in his Country, which <hi>Gruffydh</hi> for his Father's account, readily granted, and treated him honourably. A little after, his Brother <hi>Howel</hi> who was impriſoned by <hi>Ardulph</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> in the Caſtle of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> where he had remained for a great while, made his eſcape and fled to his Brother, then with <hi>Gruffydh ap Conan</hi> in <hi>North-Wales.</hi> But King <hi>Henry</hi> being informed that <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> and his Brother <hi>Howel</hi> were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> ſent very ſmooth Letters to <hi>Gruffydh ap Conan,</hi> deſiring to ſpeak with him, who being come, he received him with all the Tokens of Honor and Friendſhip, and beſtowed upon him very rich Preſents, juſt after the <hi>Norman</hi> Policy, who uſually make very much of thoſe whom they deſign afterwards to be ſerviceable to them. After ſome time's general Diſcourſe, King <hi>Henry</hi> came at length to the main Point, and promiſed the Prince even Mountains of Gold, in caſe he would ſend <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> or his Head to him, which the Prince overcome by ſuch fair Words and large Promiſes, promiſed to perform, and ſo returned joyfully home, big with the expectation of his future Reward. But ſome who wiſhed better to <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> and his Brother <hi>Howel,</hi> preſently ſuſpected the occaſion of the King's Meſſage, and therefore they adviſed them to withdraw themſelves privately for ſome time, till
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:58558:109"/> Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi>'s mind be better underſtood, and whether he had made any agreement with the King of <hi>England</hi> to betray them to him. As ſoon as the Prince was returned to his Palace at <hi>Aberffraw,</hi> he preſently enquired for <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys,</hi> and learning in a little time where he was, he ſent a Troop of Horſe to re-call him to his Court; but <hi>Gruffydh</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their approach, with all ſpeed made his eſcape to the Church of <hi>Aberdaron,</hi> and took Sanctuary there. But Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi> was ſo reſolute to make his Promiſe good to the King of <hi>England,</hi> that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to the Religious place he had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped too, commanded the ſame Meſſengers to return, and to bring him away by Force, which the Clergy of the Country unanimouſly withſtood, proteſting that they would not ſee the Liberties of the Church in the leaſt infringed. And whilſt the Clergy and the Prince's Officers were thus at debate, that ſame night, ſome who had Compaſſion upon the young Prince, and ſeeing how greedily his Life was thirſted for, conveyed him away out of <hi>North-Wales</hi> to <hi>Straywy</hi> in <hi>South-Wales.</hi> And ſo being delivered from the treacherous and more diſhonourable Practices of the Prince of <hi>North Wales,</hi> he was forced for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his own Life, to bid open Defiance to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and thereupon having raiſed all the Forces which the ſhortneſs of the opportunity would permit, he made War upon the <hi>Flemings</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>

Finding this place impregnable, he came before <hi>Abertawy</hi>-Caſtle, which was built by <hi>Henry Beaumont</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:58558:109"/> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> but this proving too ſtrong to be quickly ſurrendered, after he had burnt ſome of the outward Buildings, he returned to <hi>Stratywy,</hi> burning and deſtroying all the Country as he went along.

The <hi>Normans</hi> and <hi>Flemings</hi> were cruelly enraged with theſe continual Depredations, and how to remedy this Miſchief, was not eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; but after long Conſultation, they thought it the beſt way to call together ſuch <hi>Welch</hi> Lords as were Friends to the King of <hi>England,</hi> ſuch were <hi>Owen ap Rhytherch,</hi> and <hi>Rhytherch ap Theodore,</hi> with his Sons <hi>Meredith</hi> and <hi>Owen,</hi> whoſe Mother was <hi>Heynyth</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Blethyn ap Confyn,</hi> and <hi>Owen ap Caradoc</hi> the Son of <hi>Gwenlhian</hi> another Daughter of <hi>Blethyn,</hi> and <hi>Meredith ap Rhytherch.</hi> Theſe proteſting their Loyalty and Fidelity to King <hi>Henry</hi> were deſired to defend the King's Caſtle of <hi>Carmardhyn,</hi> and that by turns; <hi>Owen ap Caradoc</hi> the firſt Fortnight, and then by ſucceſſion by <hi>Rhytherch ap Theodore</hi> and <hi>Mered th ap Rhytherch.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:58558:110"/> Heels, fell in among the Enemy; but having none to ſupport him, his Men being all fled, he was after a manful Defence cut in pieces, and ſo the Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, <hi>Gruffydh</hi> burnt every thing to the ground, excepting the Caſtle, which was alſo ſore defaced. And then returning with a great deal of Spoil and Booty to his uſual reſidence at <hi>Stratywy;</hi> his Forces were conſiderably increaſed by the acceſſion of many ſtout young Men, who came to him from all Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and thought that Fortune ſo proſpered his Arms, that no body was able to ſtand before him. After this he marched to <hi>Gwyr,</hi> but <hi>William de Londres</hi> thinking it impoſſible to ſtand before him, forſook the Caſtle with all his Men in all haſte, ſo that when <hi>Gruffydh</hi> was come thither, he found a great deal of Cattel and Spoil, and none to own them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore having burnt down the Caſtle, he carried away every thing of Value in the Country. When the <hi>Cardigan-ſhire</hi> Men heard how fortunately he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in all his Attempts, and being extreamly fearful, leſt his next Expedition ſhould be againſt them, ſent to him, deſiring him, as being their near Relation and Country man, to take upon him the Rule and Government over them. <hi>Gruffydh</hi> willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accepted of their Offer, and coming thither, was joyfully received by the Chief Men in the Country, who were <hi>Cadifor ap Grono, Howel ap Dinerth,</hi> and <hi>Trahaern ap Ithel,</hi> which three Perſons had forſaken <hi>Dyfed,</hi> by reaſon that it was ſo thwacked with <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Flemings</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men. Nor was <hi>Cardigan</hi> free from Strangers, who pretended to ſway and rule the Country, but the People bearing in mind the continual Wrong and Oppreſſion they received from them, bore an inveterate hatred to them, and were very glad to be delivered from their inſolent and imperious Oppreſſours. For King <hi>Henry</hi> what by Force and Baniſhment of thoſe that ſtood up ſtiff for their Liberty, and what by corrupting of thoſe that were wavering, had brought all that Country to his ſubjection, and beſtowed what Lands he thought fit upon his <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Norman</hi> Favourites. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:58558:110"/> the Strength of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <hi>Gruffydh</hi> was not a whit caſt down, but boldly coming on to <hi>Cardigan Iſcoed,</hi> he laid Siege to a Fort that Earl <hi>Gilbert</hi> and the <hi>Flemings</hi> had built at a place called <hi>Blaen Porth Gwythan.</hi> After divers Aſſaults, and the killing of ſeveral of the beſieged, with the loſs only of one of his Men, <hi>Gruffydh</hi> took the place, and raſing it to the ground, brought all the Country thereabouts to ſubjection. This Action proved very fatal to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for immediately upon this, they began to forſake their Houſes and Habitations, as thinking it too hot for them to ſtay any longer in the Country, and ſo the <hi>Welch</hi> burnt and deſtroyed as far as <hi>Penwedic</hi> all the Houſes of thoſe Strangers whom Earl <hi>Gilbert</hi> had brought with him. Then <hi>Gruffydh</hi> beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Stradpythylh</hi> which belonged to <hi>Ralph</hi> Earl <hi>Gilbert</hi>'s Steward, and having made himſelf Maſter of it, he put all the Garriſon to the Sword. Removing from thence, he incamped at <hi>Glaſgryg</hi> a mile from <hi>Lhanbadarn,</hi> purpoſing to Beſiege <hi>Aberyſtwith</hi>-Caſtle next morning, but for want of Proviſion neceſſary for his Army, he was forced to make bold with ſome Cattel which grazed within the Limits of the Sanctuary. And here it may be obſerved, that not only Men enjoyed the Privilege of theſe Sanctuaries, but alſo Cattel and Horſes, and whatever elſe lived within the Liberties of them. But the day following, <hi>Gruffydh</hi> marched diſorderly towards the Caſtle, being apprehenſive of no great oppoſition, by reaſon that he was ignorant of the number of the Garriſon, and ſo encamping upon an oppoſite Hill, which was divided from the Caſtle by a River, with a Bridge over it, he called a Council to determin with what Engines they might with beſt Succeſs play againſt it, and ſo make a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, Aſſault. The <hi>Normans</hi> obſerving their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, very cunningly ſent out ſome of their Archers to skirmiſh with them, and ſo by little and little to entice them to the Bridge, where ſome of the beſt armed Horſe-men were ready to iſſue out upon them. The <hi>Welch</hi> not thinking the Garriſon to be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:58558:111"/> ſo ſtrong, approached near the Bridg, ſtill skirmiſhing with the <hi>Normans,</hi> who pretended to give ground; but when they came very near, out ſallies one on horſe back, who would fain paſs the Bridg; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received upon the points of their Spears, he began to flag, and as he endeavoured to return, he fell off his Horſe, and ſo the <hi>Welch</hi> purſued him over the Bridg. The <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ſeeing this, fled towards the Caſtle, and the <hi>Welch</hi> with all ſpeed followed them to the top of the Hill; but whilſt they thought that the day was their own, up riſes a Party of Horſe which lay in ambuſcade under the Hill, and ſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Welch</hi> and the Bridg, prevented any Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour to come to them. And the <hi>Welch</hi> being thus hemm'd in betwixt both Parties, the former recoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with greater ſtrength, were ſo unmercifully cut off, that ſcarce one Man was left living. When the reſt of the <hi>Welch</hi> Army, that ſtaid on the other ſide of the River, ſaw what number the Garriſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and that they were ſtrong beyond their expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, preſently decamped, and with all ſpeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of the Country.</p>
               <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> was informed of all the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and Cruelties that <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted among his Subjects in <hi>Wales,</hi> he ſent for <hi>Owen ap Cadwgan,</hi> deſiring him and <hi>Lhywarch ap Trahaern</hi> to uſe all the effectual Method poſſible to take or kill the Arch Rebel <hi>Gruffydh,</hi> promiſing very ſpeedily to ſend his Son <hi>Robert</hi> with an Army to <hi>Wales</hi> for that purpoſe. <hi>Owen</hi> being very proud that the King put ſuch Confidence in him, encouraged his Men to be now ſo induſtrious to merit the King's Favour, as they had been formerly to deſerve his Diſpleaſure; and ſo joyning his Forces with <hi>Lhywarch,</hi> they both marched to meet Prince <hi>Robert</hi> at <hi>Stratywy,</hi> where they ſuppoſed <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> had hid himſelf in the Woods. When they were come to the Frontiers of the Country, they made a Vow, that they would let neither Man, Woman, or Child eſcape alive; which ſo affrighted the People of the Country, that all made what ſhift they could to ſave their Lives,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58558:111"/> ſome by fleeing to the Woods and Mountains, and ſome by getting into the King's Caſtles, from whence they had come but a little before. Then <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>Lhywarch</hi> ſeparated with diſtinct Parties to ſcour the Woods, which about <hi>Stratywy</hi> are very deſertous; and <hi>Owen</hi> having entred with an Hundred Men, preſently diſcovered the tract of Men and Cattel, and follow'd their Foot-ſteps ſo cloſe, that within a little while he overtook them; and having ſlain a great many of them, and put the reſt to flight, he carried away all their Cattel back to his Army. But whilſt <hi>Owen</hi> was buſie in ſearching the Woods, <hi>Gerald</hi> Steward of <hi>Pembrock,</hi> who with a great Power of <hi>Flemings</hi> was upon his march to joyn the King's Son, met with them who fled from <hi>Owen;</hi> who deſiring help of <hi>Gerald,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared how <hi>Owen</hi> had forcibly drove them out, ſlain a great many of their Companions, and ſpoiled them of all their Goods. <hi>Gerald</hi> and his <hi>Flemings</hi> underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that <hi>Owen</hi> was ſo nigh with ſuch a ſmall number of Men, thought he had now very convenient oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be revenged of him upon the account of his Wife; and therefore to make ſure Work with him, he purſued him cloſe into the Woods. <hi>Owen</hi> being fore-warned by his Men that a great number follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and adviſed to make all ſpeed to get away, was deaf to all ſuch Counſels, as thinking that they of whom his Men were ſo much afraid of, were the King's Friends, and therefore their Integrity need not be queſtioned, ſince they all had reſpect to the ſame common Cauſe. But he found, that a private Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel is ſometime more regarded than the publick Good; and therefore when <hi>Gerald</hi> was advanced within bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, he greeted him with a Volloy of Arrows, to ſhew how great a Friend he was; but <hi>Owen,</hi> tho perſuaded to flee, was ſo little terrified at ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom Salutation, that tho' the Enemy were Seven to One, yet he told them, that they were but <hi>Flemings,</hi> and ſuch as always trembled at the hearing of his Name. And then falling on with a great deal of Courage, he was at the firſt On-let ſtruck with an Arrow into the Heart, of which Wound he preſently
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:58558:112"/> dyed; which when his Men ſaw, they all fled, and brought word to <hi>Lhywarch</hi> and the reſt of their Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of what had happen'd; and ſo ſuſpecting the King's Army, ſeeing they could not be truſted in their Service, they all returned to their reſpective Countries. <hi>Owen</hi> being in this manner unhappily ſlain, his Brethren divided his Lands betwixt them; excepting <hi>Caereneon,</hi> which properly belonged to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawc ap Ryryd ap Blethyn;</hi> and which he had forcibly taken away from his Uncle <hi>Meredith.</hi> His Father <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwgan</hi> had ſeveral Children by different Women; and beſides himſelf, he had Iſſue <hi>Madawc</hi> by <hi>Gwen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lhian</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Gruffydh ap Conan; Eineon</hi> by <hi>Sanna</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Dyfnwal; Morgan,</hi> by <hi>Efelhiw</hi> or <hi>Elhiw</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Cadifor ap Colhoyn</hi> Lord of <hi>Dyfed; Henry</hi> and <hi>Gruffydh</hi> were by the Daughter of the Lord <hi>Pigot</hi> his wedded Wife; <hi>Meredith</hi> by <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruron Hoedliw;</hi> and himſelf by <hi>Inerth</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Edwyn.</hi> But a while afterwards, <hi>Eineon ap Cadw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> and <hi>Gruffydh ap Meredith ap Blethyn,</hi> beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Cymmer</hi> in <hi>Merionythſhire,</hi> which was lately built by <hi>

The <hi>Scots</hi> thought to make good advantage of theſe Commotions in <hi>England;</hi> and thereupon, as ſoon as they heard that ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility were in actual Rebellion againſt the King, they entered into the Borders, and began, as they thought, without any apprehenſion of Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ravage and lay waſte the Country before 'em. But <hi>William,</hi> Earl of <hi>Albemarle; William Pyppell,</hi> Earl of <hi>Nottingham; Walter Eſpec</hi> and <hi>Gilbert La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> gathered together all the Forces they could raiſe in the North; and being animated and encouraged by the eloquent and preſſing Oration of <hi>Ralph,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Orkneys,</hi> which he delivered in the audience of the whole Army, they ſet upon the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merton</hi> with ſuch unanimous Courage, that after a very great ſlaughter of his Men, King <hi>David</hi> was glad to eſcape with his Life by flight.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:58558:120"/> out, which rouz'd him out of this lethargical Fit of Sorrow and Diſcontent; the Caſtle of <hi>Mould</hi> was ſo very ſtrong and well garriſon'd by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that it mightily annoyed the Country thereabouts, and had been frequently beſieged, but could never be taken. Prince <hi>Owen</hi> at this time levied an Army and laid cloſe ſiege to it; and the Gariſon for ſeveral aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults behaved it ſelf ſo manfully, that the place ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed impregnable and invincible. But the Preſence and Example of Prince <hi>Owen</hi> ſo encouraged his Men, that they fell on with all poſſible Vigour and Might, and at laſt forced their entrance into the Caſtle. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put a great number of the Garriſon to the Sword, and taken the reſt Priſoners, the Caſtle was raſed to the ground; and this fortunate Attempt ſo pleaſed the Prince, that he forgot all Sorrow for his Son, and returned to his uſual Temper and accuſtomed Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. At the ſame time, King <hi>Stephen</hi> of <hi>England</hi> obtained a remarkable Victory over his Enemies at <hi>Farendon;</hi> and although the enſuing Year <hi>Rondel</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and he were reconciled, yet he thought it more adviſeable to detain him Priſoner, though contrary to his promiſe, until ſuch time as the Earl would deliver up the Caſtle of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> with all the Forts and places of ſtrength in his cuſtody.</p>

Having viewed the Strength and Fortification of the Caſtle, he found it was impracticable to take the place, without the Walls could be deſtroyed; and therefore he gave orders, that certain battering
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:58558:120"/> Engines ſhould be provided, whilſt the reſt ſhould gaul and moleſt the beſieged, by throwing of great Stones into the Caſtle. The Enemies perceiving what irreſiſtible Preparations the Beſiegers contrived, thought it to no purpoſe to withſtand their Fury; and therefore to do that voluntarily which muſt be done by compulſion, they preſently yielded up the Caſtle. Shortly after this a great Difference happen'd betwixt the Sons of Prince <hi>Owen, Howel,</hi> and <hi>Conan,</hi> and their Uncle <hi>Cadwalader;</hi> whereupon the former entered with an Army into the Country of <hi>Merionyth,</hi> and committed great Waſtes and Hoſtilities there, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that the Inhabitants flock'd into Sanctuaries to ſave their Lives. But the young Lords finding what fearful and unſtable condition the People were in, and the better to draw them to their ſide, iſſued out their Proclamation, aſſuring that all who would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their Country, ſhould not only enjoy their Lives, but their former Liberty and accuſtomed Priviledges; upon the publication of which Edict, the People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their own Habitations. Having by this Stratagem brought all the Country under their own Pleaſure and good Will, they lead their Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Caſtle of <hi>Cynfael,</hi> belonging to <hi>Cadwala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which he had built and ſtrongly fortified. The government of this Caſtle <hi>Cadwalader</hi> had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Merfyn,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Tygwyn,</hi> or the <hi>White-Houſe;</hi> who being ſummoned to ſurrender, by the Brothers <hi>Howel</hi> and <hi>Conan,</hi> did not only refuſe, but defied their utmoſt Efforts upon the place. The Lords finding they could do no good by Threats and Menaces, judged it more convenient to make uſe of the other Extream; and therefore promiſed the Abbot a very high Reward, if he would deliver the Caſtle into their hands. But all proved to no effect, the Abbot being a Perſon of more Honeſty and greater Honour, than to be corrupted to betray his Truſt; told them flatly, That he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Maſters expectation, and therefore would chooſe rather to dye with Honour, than to live with Shame. The Lords finding him inexorable, and withal
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:58558:121"/> being vexed, that a Church-man ſhould put ſuch a ſtop to their fortunate Proceedings, made ſuch a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Aſſault upon the Caſtle, that after they had pulled down ſome part of the Walls, they entred in by force, and ravaged ſo furiouſly, that they killed and wounded the whole Garriſon, the <hi>Abbot</hi> only e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping, who by the help of ſome of his Friends in <hi>Howel</hi>'s Army, got away ſafe.

But they paid very dear for it, for all the Strength of the Iſland being met together, they ſet upon them in their return to their Ships, and cut them off in ſuch a manner, that not one remained to bring Tidings to the Fleet of what had befel them. But they on Board quickly perceived what had happened, and therefore thought it not very ſafe harbouring upon that Coaſt, but judging it more adviſable to weigh Anchor, they preſently ſet Sail for <hi>Cheſter;</hi> when they were arrived thither, they found that a Peace was actually concluded betwixt King <hi>Henry</hi> and Prince <hi>Owen</hi> upon theſe Articles; That <hi>Cadwalader</hi> ſhould have all his Lands reſtored to him, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to the Favour and Friendſhip of his Brother. Then King <hi>Henry</hi> leaving the Caſtles of <hi>Ruthlan</hi> and <hi>Baſingwerk</hi> well manned and fortified, and having near the latter founded a Publick Structure for the Order of Knights Templars, returned to <hi>England.</hi> But the troubles of <hi>Wales</hi> did not end with him, for <hi>Iorwerdh Goch ap Meredith</hi> who had taken part with the King of <hi>England</hi> during this War, laid Siege to the Caſtle of <hi>Yale,</hi> which was built by Prince <hi>Owen,</hi> and making himſelf Maſter of it, raſed it to the ground.</p>
               <p>The next Year commenced with a very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <label type="milestone">

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:58558:125"/> were quickly mitigated by a general Peace which was preſently after this concluded betwixt the King of <hi>England</hi> and all the Princes and Lords of <hi>Wales, Rhys ab Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> Prince of <hi>South-Wales</hi> only excepted. For this Prince <hi>Rhys,</hi> who probably would not rely too far upon the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Fidelity, refuſed to conſent to a Peace; but however, to ſecure himſelf the beſt he could from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom he had no ſmall reaſon to be afraid of, he thought it his beſt Prudence to iſſue out his Orders, commanding his Subjects to remove their Cattel and other Effects to the Wilderneſs of <hi>Tywy,</hi> where they were like to remain ſecureſt from the Eyes and reach of the Enemies. But he had not continued there long, when he received a more po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Expreſs from King <hi>Henry,</hi> commanding him to appear forthwith at his Court, and to accept of the Propoſals of Peace, before the joynt Forces of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> and <hi>Wales</hi> were ſent to fetch him up. Prince <hi>Rhys</hi> having received ſuch a threatning Meſſage, thought it now high time to repent of what he had afore ſo raſhly reſolved upon, and therefore after long Conſultation, he judged it his wiſeſt way to accept of the King's Propoſals and to appear at Court. There it was agreed upon, that <hi>Rhys,</hi> whoſe Lands heretofore lay ſcattered about, and were intermixed with other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Eſtate, ſhould enjoy <hi>Cantref Mawr,</hi> and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cantref which the King ſhould be pleaſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon him. But contrary to this Article, the King aſſigned him ſeveral Lordſhips and other Lands far remote from each other, and particularly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed them with the Eſtates of <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> whom he was ſure would be a watch and a curb to all the motions of Prince <hi>Rhys.</hi> This was indeed a very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Contrivance or King <hi>Henry</hi> to keep under the high and reſtleſs Spirit of <hi>Rhys;</hi> but the Juſtice of the Action does not ſo evidently appear in breaking one of the chiefeſt Articles of the Peace, and chopping and beſtowing that which was not juſtly in his Power to give. But 'tis manifeſtly apparent that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of theſe times were mainly concerned right
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:58558:125"/> or wrong to oppreſs and keep under the <hi>Welch</hi> of whoſe mortal hatred to ſubjection they had ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and ſo cruelly felt. Prince <hi>Rhys</hi> was not at all ignorant of theſe wrongful and deceitful Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of King <hi>Henry,</hi> but knowing himſelf to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to redreſs theſe Grievances, he thought it more adviſible for a time to live quietly with a little than raſhly to hazard all. But in a ſhort time, he had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity either to demand redreſs from the King, or elſe to endeavour it himſelf by Force of Arms. For as ſoon as <hi>Roger</hi> Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> was informed of the diſtribution which the King of <hi>England</hi> had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Prince <hi>Rhys,</hi> he came to King <hi>Henry,</hi> requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Majeſty, that he would grant him ſuch Lands in <hi>Wales,</hi> as he could win by force of Arm<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> The King readily complied with his Requeſt, being always very forward to grant any thing which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to curb and diſcommode the <hi>Welch,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> marched with a great Army into <hi>Cardigan,</hi> and having fortified the Caſtles of <hi>Yſtrat-Meyric, Humphrey, Dyfi, Dynerth</hi> and <hi>Lhanrhy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtyd,</hi> he made ſeveral Incurſions into the Country. In the ſame manner, <hi>Walter Clyfford</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Lhanymdhyfri</hi> Caſtle, made in-roads into the Territories of Prince <hi>Rhys,</hi> and after he had ſlain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the <hi>Welch,</hi> and made great waſte in the Country, returned with conſiderable Booty.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Rhys</hi> as he was unable to bear theſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, ſo he was reſolved either to have immediate redreſs, or elſe to proclaim open War againſt the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> and therefore he ſent an Expreſs to King <hi>Henry,</hi> complaining of the Hoſtilities which his Subjects the Earl of <hi>Clare</hi> and <hi>Walter Clifford</hi> had committed in in his Country. But finding the King to put him ſtill off with only ſmooth Words and fair Promiſes, and that he always winked at the Faults of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> without any farther Conſultation about the Matter, he laid Siege to the Caſtle of <hi>Lhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ymdhyfri,</hi> and in ſhort time made himſelf Matter of it. Alſo <hi>Eineon</hi> the Son of <hi>Anarawd, Rhy</hi>'s Brother's Son, and a Perſon of great Valor, being deſirous to

               <p>Towards the beginning of this Year, <hi>Madoc ap Meredith ap Blethyn</hi> Prince of <hi>Powis</hi> died at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> whence his Body was honourably conveyed to <hi>Powis,</hi> and buried at <hi>Myfod.</hi> He was a Prince very much affected to Piety and Religion, very cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable to the neceſſitous, and good to the diſtreſſed; but his great Fault was, that he ſtickled too hard for the Intereſt of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and was always in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy with King <hi>Henry</hi> againſt the good Succeſs of his Native Country. He had Iſſue by his Wife <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Gruffydh ap Conan</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> three Sons, <hi>Gruffydh Maylor, Owen</hi> and <hi>Elis,</hi> and a Daughter named <hi>Marred.</hi> He had alſo three natural Sons, <hi>Owen Brogynton, Cynwric Efelh,</hi> and <hi>Eineon Efelh,</hi> who tho' baſe born, yet according to the Cuſtom of <hi>Wales,</hi> co-inherited with their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who were legitimate.</p>
               <p>And here it will not be amiſs, once for all, to give a particular account of the Principality, afterwards the Lordſhips of <hi>Powis,</hi> how it came to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into many ſhares and portions, and by that means became ſo irrecoverably broken and weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was made ſubject to the <hi>Normans</hi> before the reſt of <hi>Wales.</hi> For <hi>Powis</hi> before King <hi>Offa</hi>'s time, reached Eaſtward to the Rivers of <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Dee,</hi> in a right Line from the end of <hi>Broxen</hi> Hills to <hi>Salop,</hi> and comprehended all the Country between the <hi>Wye</hi> and <hi>Severn,</hi> which was antiently the Eſtate of <hi>Broch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel Yſcithroc,</hi> of whom mention is made before. But after the making of <hi>Offa</hi>'s dike, <hi>Powis</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into a narrower compaſs, the plain Country toward <hi>Salop</hi> being inhabited by <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Normans,</hi> ſo that the length of it reached North-Eaſt, from

                  <hi>Pulford</hi>-Bridge to <hi>Lhangiric</hi>-Pariſh on the Confines of <hi>Cardigan</hi>-ſhire, to the South-Weſt, and the breadth from the fartheſt part of <hi>Cyfeilioc</hi> Weſtward, to <hi>Elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere</hi> on the Eaſt-ſide.

But ſome of the <hi>Welch</hi> took advantage of this opportunity, who being well acquainted with the Paſſage, without the knowledg of their Officers, fell upon the King's Guard, where all the Pike-men were poſted; and after a hot Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, ſeveral were ſlain on both ſides. But in fine, the King wan the paſſage, and ſo marched on to the Mountain of <hi>Berwyn,</hi> where he lay ſometime without any Hoſtility on either ſide, both Armies ſtanding in fear of each other. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> kept the open Plains,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:58558:132"/> and were afraid to be entrapp'd in the Streights and narrow Paſſages; and the <hi>Welch</hi> on the other hand watched the Advantage of the place, and obſerved the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo narrowly, that neither Forage or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals could paſs to the King's Camp. And what augmented the miſery of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, there happened to fall ſuch a Rain, that mightily diſturbed their Encampment, in ſo much that the Soldiers could ſcarcely ſtand, for the diſadvantage of thoſe ſlippery Hills. But in the end King <hi>Henry</hi> was forced to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp, and after a very conſiderable loſs of Men and Ammunition, beſides the great Charges of this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, was compell'd to return back to <hi>England.</hi> But to expreſs the great diſſatisfaction he entertained of this Enterprize, in a great fury he plucked out the Eyes of the Hoſtages, which he had ſome time afore received from the <hi>Welch;</hi> which were <hi>Rhys</hi> and <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walhon</hi> the Sons of <hi>Owen</hi> Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and <hi>Cynric</hi> and <hi>Meredith</hi> the Sons of <hi>Rhys</hi> of <hi>South-Wales.</hi> Some write, that in aſſailing of a Bridg, the King was in no ſmall danger of his Life; one of the <hi>Welch</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving aimed directly at him, was like to pierce him through the Body, had not <hi>Hubert de Clare,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>Colcheſter,</hi> who perceived the Arrow a coming, thruſt himſelf betwixt the King and it, though to the loſs of his own Life.</p>
               <p>But though King <hi>Henry</hi> was ſhamefully forced to return to <hi>England,</hi> yet he did not give over the thoughts of ſubduing the <hi>Welch;</hi> and therefore after a long Conſultation, he made a third Expedition into <hi>Wales,</hi> conveying his Army by Sea, as far as <hi>Cheſter.</hi> There he ſtaid for ſome time, till all his Fleet, as well thoſe Ships that he had hired out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> as his own, were all arrived. But when they were all come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and got ſafely to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> his mind was alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and inſtead of a deſign againſt <hi>Wales,</hi> he unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly diſmiſſed his whole Army. Prince <hi>Rhys</hi> was glad of this opportunity, and therefore withdrawing his Forces from the Confederate Army, he marched to the Siege of <hi>Aberteifi</hi> Caſtle, which being ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to him, he raſed to the ground. From thence
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:58558:133"/> he got before <hi>Cilgerran,</hi> which he uſed after the ſame manner, and therein took Priſoner <hi>Robert</hi> the Son of <hi>Stephen</hi> his Coſin-German, who was the Son of <hi>Neſt</hi> his Aunt, who after the death of <hi>Gerald,</hi> had married <hi>Stephen</hi> Conſtable.

But <hi>Madawc,</hi> another of <hi>Owen Gwynedh</hi>'s Sons, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how his Brothers contended for the Principality, and that his native Country was like to be turmoil'd in a Civil War, did think it his better Prudence to try his Fortune abroad; and therefore leaving <hi>North-Wales</hi> in a very unſettled condition, ſailed with a ſmall Fleet of Ships which he had rigg'd and man'd for that purpoſe, to the Weſtward; and leaving <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> upon the <hi>North,</hi> he came at length to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Country, where moſt things appeared to him new and uncuſtomary, and the manner of the Natives far different from what he had ſeen in <hi>Europe.</hi> This Country, ſays the learned <hi>H.

But concerning <hi>Madawc</hi>'s Voyage to this Country, and afterwards his return from thence; there be many fabulous Stories and idle Tales invented by the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, who are ſure never to diminiſh from what they hear, but will add to and increaſe any Fable as far as their Invention will prompt them. However ſays the ſame Author, it is certain that <hi>Madawc</hi> arrived in this Country, and after he had viewed the Fertility and Pleaſantneſs of it, he thought it expedient to invite
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:58558:135"/> more of his Countrymen out of <hi>Britain;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaving moſt of thoſe he had brought with him already behind, he returned for <hi>Wales.</hi> Being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived there, he began to acquaint his Friends with what a fair and extenſive Land he had met with, void of any Inhabitants, whilſt they employed all their Skill to ſupplant one another, only for a ragged Portion of Rocks and Mountains; and therefore he would perſuade them to change their preſent ſtate of Danger and continual Claſhings for a more quiet Being of Eaſe and Enjoyment. And ſo having got a conſiderable Number of <hi>Welch</hi> together, he bid his final adieu to his Native Country, and ſailed with Ten Ships back to them he had left behind. It is therefore to be ſuppoſed, ſays our Authour, that <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dawc</hi> and his People inhabited part of that Country, ſince called <hi>Florida,</hi> by reaſon that it appears from <hi>Francis Loves,</hi> an Author of no ſmall Reputation, that in <hi>Acuſanus</hi> and other places, the People ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured and worſhipped the Croſs; whence it may be naturally concluded, that Chriſtians had been there before the coming of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and who theſe Chriſtians might be, unleſs it were this Colony of <hi>Madawcs,</hi> cannot be eaſily imagined. But by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the <hi>Welch</hi> who came over, were not many, they intermixt in a few Years with the Natives of the Country, and ſo following their Manners and uſing their Language, they became at length undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhable from the Barbarians. But the Country which <hi>Madawc</hi> landed in is by the learned Dr. <hi>Powel</hi> ſuppoſed to be part <hi>Mexico;</hi> for which Conjecture he lays down theſe following Reaſons; Firſt, as it is recorded in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Chronicles of the Conqueſt of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> the Inhabitants and Natives of that Country affirm by Tradition, that their Rulers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from a ſtrange Nation, which came thither from a ſtrange Country; as it was confeſſed by King <hi>Montezeuma,</hi> in a Speech at his Submiſſion to the King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> before <hi>Hernando Cortez</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> General. And then the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Words and Names of Places uſed in that Country, even at this day do
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:58558:135"/> undoubtedly argue the ſame; as when they ſpeak and confabulate together, they uſe this <hi>Britiſh</hi> Word <hi>Gwrando,</hi> which ſignifies to hearken or liſten; and a certain Bird with a white Head, they call <hi>Fengwyn,</hi> which ſignifies the ſame in <hi>Welch.</hi> But for a more complete confirmation of this, the Iſland of <hi>Corroeſo,</hi> the Cape of <hi>Bryton,</hi> the River of <hi>Gwyndor,</hi> and the white Rock of <hi>Pengwyn,</hi> which are all <hi>Britiſh</hi> Words do manifeſtly ſhew, that it was that Country which <hi>Madawe</hi> and his People inhabited.</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:58558:136"/> the Expedition was unanimouſly concluded upon; and ſo the King ſet upon his Journey, and coming towards <hi>Wales,</hi> he was received by Prince <hi>Rhys,</hi> whoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion the King liked ſo well, that he preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to him all his Lands in <hi>South-Wales.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the King's Favour <hi>Rhys</hi> promiſed his Majeſty 300 Horſes and 4000 Oxen toward the Conqueſt of <hi>Ireland;</hi> for the ſure payment of which, he delivered Fourteen Pledges.

But <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werth</hi> was not ſo eaſie-mouth'd, as to be ſo unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly curb'd by the King; and therefore departing in a great fury from the King's preſence, he called to him his two Sons <hi>Owen</hi> and <hi>Howel,</hi> whom he had by <hi>Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>harad</hi> the Daughter of <hi>

The King was in the mean time upon his Journey to <hi>Pembroke,</hi> where being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by Prince <hi>Rhys,</hi> he gave him a grant of all <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Yſtratywy, Arustly,</hi> and <hi>Eluel;</hi> in Recompence of all the Civilities and Honour he paid him. And ſo <hi>Rhys</hi> returned to <hi>Aberteifi,</hi> a Town he had lately won from the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and there having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared his Preſent, about the beginning of <hi>October</hi> he returned again to <hi>Pembrock,</hi> having ordered Eighty Six Horſes to follow him; which being preſented to the King, he accepted of Thirty Six of the choiceſt, and returned the reſt with great Thanks. The ſame day King <hi>Henry</hi> went to S. <hi>Davids,</hi> and after he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the Memory of that Saint, he dined with the Biſhop, who was the Son of <hi>Gerald,</hi> Coſin-German

But on the other ſide, to avenge the Death of his Son, who was ſo cowardly cut off; he preſently raiſed all the Forces that himſelf and the reſt of his Friends were able to do; and ſo entering into <hi>England,</hi> he deſtroyed with Fire and Sword all the Country, to the Gates of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> But the King was ſo intent upon his return, that he ſeemed to take no great notice of what <hi>Iorwerth</hi> was doing; and therefore having by Commiſſion conſtituted Lord <hi>Rhys</hi> Chief Juſtice of all <hi>South-Wales,</hi> he forthwith took his Journey to <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi> About this time dyed <hi>Cadwalader ap Gruffydh,</hi> the Son of <hi>Gruffydh ap Conan,</hi> ſometime Prince of <hi>North-Wales;</hi> who by his Wife, <hi>Alice</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Richard Clare</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> had Iſſue, <hi>Cunetha, Radulph,</hi> and <hi>Richard;</hi> and by other Women, <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan, Cadwalader, Eineon, Meredith Goch,</hi> and <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walhon.</hi> Towards the end of this Year <hi>Sitſylht ap Dyfn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal</hi> and <hi>Iefan ap Sitſylht ap Riryd,</hi> ſurprized the Caſtle of <hi>Abergavenny,</hi> which belonged to the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and having made themſelves Maſters of it, they took the whole Garriſon Priſoners.</p>

And though his Father <hi>Iorwerth</hi> had been incapable of taking upon him the Government by reaſon of ſome Infirmity; yet there was no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that his Fathers Weakneſs ſhould exclude and turn him out; and therefore, being now ſenſible of what he was not capable to underſtand in his youth, he laid claim to the Principality, which was juſtly his own. But there was no great need of conjur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to underſtand his Claim, nor of much Rhetorick to perſuade the People to own him for their Prince; whoſe Affection was cooled, and almoſt worn off from <hi>David,</hi> ever ſince he had dealt ſo unnatural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his Brothers, whom after he had deprived of their Eſtates, he baniſhed out of the Country.

For upon this <hi>Geoffrey Fitz-Peter,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of <hi>England</hi> levies a conſiderable Army, to which he joyns all the Lords Marchers, and comes in all haſt to the Relief of the place, where he meets <hi>Gwenwynwyn;</hi> with whom, before he would hazard a Battel, he was deſirous to have a Treaty of Peace, to which <hi>Gwenwynwyn</hi> and his Adherents would in no wiſe hearken or condeſcend, but returned in anſwer, that their buſineſs there was to be revenged of old In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done them. Hereupon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Lords reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to enlarge Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi> of <hi>South-Wales,</hi> whom they knew to be an inveterate Enemy of <hi>Gwenwyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyn,</hi> as he that delivered him up to their hands; and likewiſe to be a Man of great Authority in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, therefore they rightly concluded he might be more ſerviceable to them when at liberty than under confinement, wherein they were not diſappointed; for he immediately got together a ſtrong Body of his Countrymen, and joyning with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards the Caſtle, where they furiouſly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd <hi>Gwenwynwyn,</hi> who made no leſs vigorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; hereupon there enſued a bloody Battel, with a great ſlaughter on both ſides, but at length the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> got the Victory, and <hi>Gwenwynwyn</hi> loſt a great number of common Soldiers (if we believe <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> 3700 Men) beſides a great many of his beſt

Meredith ap Conan</hi> was likewiſe taken Priſoner, with many more. After this the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> returned home triumphantly, and requited Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi>'s Service with a perfect Liberty, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, partly by his own Force, partly by the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his People, repoſſeſſed himſelf of all his Dominions, ſave the Caſtles of <hi>Aberteifi</hi> and <hi>Yſtratmey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> which his uſurping Brother <hi>Maelgon,</hi> by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of <hi>Gwenwynwyn,</hi> had, during his Confinement by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> taken from him, and ſtill unjuſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Hereupon, ſome of Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi>'s prime Nobility and Clergy came to him, and offered him their Endeavours of reconciling him to his Brother, and made him ſo apprehenſive of his juſt Diſpleaſure at him, that he took a ſolemn Oath before them, that in caſe his Brother would give him Hoſtages for the ſecurity of his own Perſon, he would deliver him up his Caſtle of <hi>Aberteifi</hi> by a day appointed; which Propoſals Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi> accepted of, and accordingly ſent him his Demands: But it was the leaſt of <hi>Mael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi>'s intention to make good his part, or elſe he was very unconſtant in his reſolution; for he had no ſooner received the Hoſtages, but inſtead of delivering up the Caſtle, he fortifies it, and puts in a Garriſon for his own uſe, and commits the Hoſtages to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of <hi>Gwenwynwyn,</hi> Prince <hi>Gruffydh</hi>'s mortal Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but not long after, their Innocency procured them an opportunity of an Eſcape.</p>

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:58558:148"/> to good order and Obedience; for in all things he trod in his Fathers ſteps, and made it his buſineſs to ſucceed him as well in his Valour and vertuous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, as in his Government. But the vaſt hopes conceived of him ſoon proved abortive; for in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">A.D. </seg>1202</label> Year, on S. <hi>James</hi>'s day he dyed, to the great Grief and Loſs of his Country, and ſhortly after was buried at <hi>Yſtratflur</hi> with great Pomp and Solemnity. He left behind him for a Succeſſor a Son called <hi>Rhys,</hi> which <hi>Maud</hi> the Daughter of <hi>William de Bruce</hi> had bore him. The following Year ſome of the <hi>Welch</hi> Nobility marched with an Army towards the Caſtle of <hi>Gwerthrynion,</hi> which belonged to <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> and after a ſhort Siege, they took it and levell'd it with the ground.</p>
               <p>This Year <hi>Lhewelyn ap Iorwerth</hi> calling to mind his Eſtate and Title, and how all the <hi>Welch</hi> Princes were obliged both by the Laws of <hi>Roderic</hi> the Great, and thoſe of <hi>Howel Dha</hi> to acknowledg the King or Prince of <hi>North-Wales</hi> for their Sovereign Lord, and to do Homage to him for their Dominions: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they knew this to be their duty, and that they formerly had readily performed it; yet becauſe of late Years his Predeceſſors had neglected to call them to their Duty, they now began to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin themſelves exempted from it; and ſome thought themſelves accountable to no ſuperiour Prince; others denyed Subjection to Prince <hi>Lhewelyn,</hi> and held their Dominions of the King of <hi>England.</hi> To put a ſtop therefore to the further growth of this Contempt, and to aſſert his own Right, Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> ſummons all the <hi>Welch</hi> Lords, who for the moſt part appeared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſwore Allegiance to him. But <hi>Gwenwynwyn</hi> Lord of <hi>Powys</hi> neither came to this meeting, nor would own the Princes Supremacy: Which Stubborneſs and Diſobedience the Prince acquainted his Lords with, whereupon they delivered their Opinion, that it was but reaſonable, that <hi>Gwenwynwyn</hi> ſhould be compell'd to his Duty, or elſe forfeit his Eſtate: This all the Lords conſented to, but <hi>Elis ap Madawc,</hi> who was an intimate Friend of <hi>Gwenwynwyn,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:58558:148"/> would not conſent to the enacting any thing that might be prejudicial to him, but broke off from the Meeting much diſſatisfied with their Proceedings. Notwithſtanding which, Prince <hi>Lhewelyn,</hi> purſuant to the Advice of the reſt of his Lords, raiſes an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and marches towards <hi>Powys;</hi> but before he made any uſe of it, he was by the Mediation of ſome learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and able Men reconciled to <hi>Gwenwynwyn,</hi> and ſo <hi>Gwenwynwyn</hi> became his dutiful Subject, which he confirmed both by Oath and Writing; and indeed it was not without good reaſon, that Prince <hi>Lhewe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi> uſed all the caution imaginable to bind this Man; for he had ſworn Allegiance before to the King of <hi>England. Lhewelyn</hi> having thus ſubjected <hi>Gwenwynwyn,</hi> he thought it now convenient to ſhew likewiſe ſome Marks of his Reſentments againſt his Adherent <hi>Elis ap Madawc,</hi> and therefore he ſtrips him of all his Lands; whereupon <hi>Elis</hi> fled the Country, but not long after, yielding himſelf to the Prince's Mercy, he received of him the Caſtle of <hi>Crogen,</hi> and Seven Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips beſides. And now having mentioned <hi>Crogen,</hi> it will not be improper to ſtep a little out of the way, and here take notice of the reaſon why the <hi>Engliſh</hi> formerly, when they had a mind to reproach the <hi>Welch,</hi> called them <hi>Crogens.</hi> The firſt occaſion of it was this, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second in his Expedition againſt the <hi>Welch</hi> to the Mountains of <hi>Berwin,</hi> lay a while at <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſtre,</hi> during which time he detached a number of his Men to try the Paſſages into <hi>Wales,</hi> who as they would have paſſed <hi>Offa</hi>'s Ditch at the Caſtle of <hi>Crogen,</hi> at which place there was a narrow way through the ſame Ditch, which appears now very deep through all that Country, and bears its old Name; theſe Men, I ſay, as they would have paſſed this Streight, were met by a Party of <hi>Welch,</hi> and a great many of them ſtrain and buried in that Ditch, as appears by their Graves there to be ſeen; and the Name of the Streight imports as much, being called in <hi>Welch Adwy'r bedhaw<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> therefore bearing in mind this Slaughter, when ever they got any of the <hi>Welch</hi> into their Clutches, upbraided them with
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:58558:149"/> the Name of <hi>Crogen,</hi> intimating thereby that they ſhould expect no more Favour or Mercy at their hands, than they ſhew'd them in the Skirmiſh. But this word which at firſt was rather a Badg of Reputation than Diſgrace to the <hi>Welch,</hi> came afterwards to be uſed in a bad Senſe, and only then applyed when they deſigned to reproach and abuſe them. But to return to Prince <hi>Lhewelyn,</hi> whom we find returning home after he had ſucceſsfully aſſerted his Sovereignty over all <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſet all things in good order: And by the way he fortifies the Caſtle of <hi>Bala</hi> in <hi>Penlhyn.</hi> About this time <hi>Rhys</hi> the Son of <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> the right Prince of <hi>South-Wales</hi> took the Caſtle of <hi>Lha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymdhyfry</hi> upon <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-day. This Year <hi>Lhewe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyn</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> took to Wife <hi>Joan</hi> the Daughter of King <hi>John,</hi> which <hi>Agatha</hi> Daughter of <hi>Robert Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> Earl of <hi>Derby</hi> bore him, with whom he gave the Prince for a Dowry the Lordſhip of <hi>Elſmere</hi> in the Marches of <hi>Wales.</hi>

Amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he ſends Meſſengers to <hi>William de Bruce</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Sons for Pledges, to whom <hi>Mawd, de Bruce</hi>'s Wife, being the readier ſpeaker, anſwered, (though what ſhe ſaid was no leſs her Husband's Sentiment than her own) Thar the King, who had proved ſo baſe a Guardian to his Nephew Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> whom inſtead of ſetting in, he deprived of his Right, ſhould have none of her Children. This Anſwer the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers deliver'd to the King, whereat he was highly diſpleaſed, that he ordered ſome Soldiers ſhould be ſent to ſeize this Lord, but he having timely intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of this Order, fled into <hi>Ireland</hi> with his Wife and Children, where now his Wife <hi>Mawd,</hi> with her Son, were unfortunately taken by King <hi>John,</hi> but he himſelf eſcaped, and fled into <hi>France,</hi> where not long after he dyed.</p>
               <p>This Year the Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> rebuilt the Caſtle of <hi>Dyganwy,</hi> ſituate on the Sea-ſhore, Eaſt of the River <hi>Conway,</hi> which Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> had before demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

About this time <hi>Rhys Fychan</hi> Son to Prince <hi>Rhys,</hi> fearing leſt Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> ſhould fall upon him for the wrong he had done to his Nephews, whom he, Prince <hi>Lhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welyn,</hi> ſtifly defended in their right; made his Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the King of <hi>England,</hi> who readily granted him what Succours he deſired; and with theſe he beſieged the Caſtle of <hi>Lhanymdhyfri;</hi> the Garriſon for ſome time made a vigorous defence, but having

About this time likewiſe <hi>Gwenwynwyn</hi> was ſet at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, whom the King had hitherto detained Priſoner, and withal lends him ſome Forces to attempt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his Country which Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> had ſeized upon during his Impriſonment; and tho' by his own Strength he was not able to cope with the Prince, yet by this Aſſiſtance granted him by the King, he ſoon re-poſſeſſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This Succeſs of <hi>Gwenwynwyn</hi> encouraged <hi>Maelgon</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to endeavour the recovery of that part of his Country which the Prince had taken from him in the ſame Expedition. Now he makes his application to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and ſwears Allegiance to him. Hereupon the King grants him a conſiderable Army as well <hi>Engliſh</hi> as <hi>Normans;</hi> to theſe he joyns what Forces he could raiſe in <hi>Wales,</hi> and then contrary to the Oath and Agreement he had made with his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews <hi>Rhys</hi> and <hi>Owen,</hi> he in a hoſtile manner enters their Country, when he was come to <hi>Cantred Penwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic,</hi> he encamped at <hi>Cilcenny</hi> where he ſtaid ſome time to take meaſures for the better accompliſhment of his Deſigns; by this time his Nephews had got together about 300 choſen well diſciplined Men, but with ſo ſmall a Number durſt not oppoſe their Uncle's numerous Army in open Field; therefore they were to endeavour to overthrow thoſe by a Stratagem which they could not do by main force. Herein they proved very ſucceſsful, for coming as near their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as they could without being diſcovered, they ſent out their Spies that Night for Intelligence, who brought back the good News, that all was quiet in <hi>Maelgon</hi>'s Camp, and that they kept no ſtrict Watch, being not aware of an approaching Enemy. This Intelligence mightily encouraged the Brothers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute their Deſigns, and now they march as ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently as they can towards their Enemies Camp, where they met with no oppoſition, being not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:58558:151"/> becauſe all were faſt aſleep. When they were advanced as they thought as far as <hi>Maelgon</hi>'s Tent, they furiouſly fell on, and ſlew a great number of his Men afore they awak'd; the reſt being frightened with the noiſe and ſhouts of their Enemies, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al thinking their Numbers to be far greater than it was, were glad to make uſe of the darkneſs of the Night to quit the Field, only <hi>Maelgon</hi>'s Guard vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly kept their Poſt, and defended their Lord till he had time and opportunity to eſcape. But <hi>Maelgon</hi>'s Army ſuffered very much in this Action, his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew <hi>Conan ap Howel</hi> with his Chief Counſellor <hi>Gruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fydh ap Cadwgan</hi> were both taken Priſoners, and <hi>Eineon ap Caradoc</hi> with a great number more were ſlain upon the ſpot. About the ſame time <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> fortified the Caſtle of <hi>Buelht,</hi> where a little before he had loſt a conſiderable number of his Men, by reaſon that the place was not very ſtrong and tenable. And towards the concluſion of this year, <hi>Mallt</hi> or <hi>Mawd de Bruce,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> departed this Life, and was interred by her Husband in a Monk's Coul in <hi>Yſtratflur.</hi>

But Matters of this nature are eaſier reſolved upon, than accompliſhed; Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> was no ſooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of theſe mighty preparations againſt him, comprehending the whole Strength of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, and what was worſt of all, being aſſiſted by his own Country-men, but he iſſued forth his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, commanding all his Subjects of the In-land Counties of <hi>Denbigh</hi> and <hi>Flint,</hi> together with them of the Iſland of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> to remove for a time all their Cattel and other Effects to <hi>Snowden</hi>-Hills, where they were ſure to remain ſecureſt from their Enemies. But King <hi>John</hi> marched his Army along the Sea-Coaſt to <hi>Ruthlan,</hi> and there paſſing the River <hi>Clwyd,</hi> he came to the Caſtle of <hi>Teganwy,</hi> where he encamped for ſome time to refreſh and recreate his Army, which by reaſon of the long Marches they made, was in a great meaſure weary and fatigued. But what the more augmented their miſery, <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> getting behind them, cut off all their hopes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion from <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Welch</hi> by the Advantage of being acquainted with the ſtraits and narrow Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, cut off all that ſtraggled from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Camp, ſo that in time, they were glad to take up with Horſe-fleſh, and any thing were it never ſo mean, which might till up their greedy and empty Stomachs. At laſt King <hi>John</hi> finding no other Remedy, and perceiving it impoſſible to continue longer there ſo hungry and fainty, thought it his wiſeſt way to march for <hi>England</hi> and leave the <hi>Welch</hi> to themſelves, and ſo he decamped in a great fury, leaving <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> to bury that great number of Dead, which had ſtarved in this ſuccesſleſs Expedition. But to recover the Honour he had now loſt, he was reſolved to try another touch with the <hi>Welch,</hi> but poſſibly not with the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and aſſurance of Victory. And therefore returning to <hi>Wales</hi> in the next <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he entred with ſuch another terrible Army of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted

And no better meaſures could poſſibly be thought of, than to ſend <hi>Joan</hi> his Wife, King <hi>John</hi>'s Daughter, to intreat with her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther about a Peace, and a ceſſation of all Hoſtilities; who being a prudent, ſly Woman, ſo prevailed upon the King, that he granted Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, a ſafe Conduct to come to him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the former Peace and Amity that was betwixt them. And ſo <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> having done Homage, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed the King towards his Expences in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, 20000 Head of Cattel and forty <hi>Horſes,</hi> and what was more than all, he granted all the in-land Countries of <hi>Wales,</hi> with the Appurtenances, to him and his Heirs for ever.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:58558:153"/> Sons of <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys</hi> to acknowledge him for their Sovereign, and to do him Homage. <hi>Foulke</hi> having received ſo poſitive a Command, preſently raiſed his Forces, and calling <hi>Maelgon</hi> and <hi>Rhys,</hi> came to the <hi>Cantref</hi> of <hi>Penwedic;</hi> which when the young Lords <hi>Rhys</hi> and <hi>Owen</hi> heard of, and being aſſured that this Blow was levelled againſt them, which they knew they were not able to bear, before the Stroak was ſtruck, they ſent to <hi>Foulke</hi> to ſue for Peace, and a ſafe Conduct for them to paſs to the Court of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> This being granted, they came to <hi>London,</hi> and making their ſubmiſſion to the King, and requeſting his Pardon for all former Miſdemeanors, they gave up all pretence to their Lands betwixt <hi>Aeron</hi> and <hi>Dyfi;</hi> and ſo paying their Homage, they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed very graciouſly. But <hi>Foulke</hi> before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out of the Country, fortified the Caſtle of <hi>Aberyſtwyth,</hi> and placing a ſtrong Garriſon therein, kept it to the King's uſe.

But they paid ſawce for this another way, for as ſoon as <hi>Rhys</hi> and <hi>Owen</hi> had heard that their Uncles had broken and violated the King's Peace, they made in-roads into <hi>Iſaeron,</hi> which was <hi>Maelgon</hi>'s Country, and having ſlain a conſiderable number of his Men, among whom was one brave and luſty Youth called <hi>Bachglâs,</hi> they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with very rich Booty.</p>

And ſo joyning their Forces together, they took all the Caſtles in <hi>North-Wales</hi> which were in the hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> excepting <hi>Ruthlan</hi> and <hi>Dyganwy;</hi> and then going to <hi>Powys,</hi> they laid Siege to the Caſtle which <hi>Robert <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſpont</hi> had built at <hi>Mathrafal.</hi> But King <hi>John</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing informed how the <hi>Welch</hi> had conſpired againſt him, and that they had taken and ſezied upon almoſt all his Caſtles in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and how that they were now in actual beſiegement of <hi>Mathrafal,</hi> preſently drew up his Army, and coming to <hi>Mathrafal,</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed the Siege, and to prevent the <hi>Welch</hi> from coming any more againſt it, he burnt it to the ground and ſo returned to <hi>England,</hi> having no time to ſtay any longer in <hi>Wales,</hi> by reaſon of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that happened betwixt him and his Nobility.

                  <hi>South-Wales</hi> had now been quiet for a conſiderable time, and they that uſed to be commonly very tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and contentious, were now pretty eaſy and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:58558:154"/> amicable. But it was impoſſible that ſuch a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Courſe of Life ſhould hold long, where In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Oppreſſion had ſo much Liberty, and where People were wrongfully kept out of their juſt and rightful Inheritance. And this was the occaſion of the breach of that quietneſs, which for the two or three years laſt paſt they had ſo ſatisfactorily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. For <hi>Rhys</hi> the Son of <hi>Gruffydh ap Rhys,</hi> who was right Heir to Prince <hi>Rhys,</hi> finding he could have no ſhare of his Father's Eſtate, but that his Uncles forcibly kept all from him, thought it his beſt way to make his Caſe known to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and to deſire a remedy and redreſs from him.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:58558:160"/> being ſorrowfully ſenſible how unable they were to put a ſtop to his farther progreſs by force of Arms, they made Overtures for Ceſſation of all Hoſtilities till the <hi>May</hi> following, which being granted them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrict Conditions, Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> returned to <hi>North-Wales.</hi> In the mean time ſome <hi>Welch</hi> Lords beſieged <hi>Buelht</hi> Caſtle, which was in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Reynald Bruce,</hi> but before they could take it, King <hi>Henry</hi> brought an Army to the Marches and raiſed the Siege, and then marching forward to <hi>Montgomery,</hi> built a new Caſtle in that Town.</p>

                  <hi>William Marſhal</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrock</hi> was now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and very buſie in proſecuting the War againſt the King of <hi>England's</hi> Enemies in that Kingdom; the opportunity of whoſe abſence Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> taking advantage of, won the Caſtles of <hi>Aberteifi</hi> and <hi>Caermardhyn,</hi> belonging to the Earl; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting both the Garriſons to the Sword, placed in their room a ſtrong Party of his own Men. But when the Earl was informed of what the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> had done, he preſently left <hi>Ireland,</hi> and landed at S. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> with a great Army, and having recovered his Caſtles, he treated the <hi>Welch</hi> after the ſame manner, as Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> had uſed his Garriſons, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing forward into the Prince's Country, deſtroyed all before him as he went along. The Prince under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding how violently he came forward, ſent his
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:58558:161"/> Son <hi>Gruffydh</hi> with a conſiderable Body of Men to check his Fury; who coming to <hi>Cydwely,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving intelligence that the Magiſtrates of that place, had a private deſign to betray him to the Enemy, he put the whole Town in Flames, and burnt it to the ground, without ſparing either Churches, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religious Houſes. The Earl of <hi>Pembrock</hi> had paſſed the River <hi>Tywy</hi> at <hi>Caermardhyn,</hi> where <hi>Gruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fydh</hi> met him, and gave him battel; but the Victory proved ſo uncertain, that the Night was forced to part them; and ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> retired over the River. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> writes, that the Earl obtained a very ſignal Victory, and that of the <hi>Welch</hi> there were Nine Thouſand ſlain and taken; though the <hi>Welch</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which in this caſe is in all likelihood the beſt, makes the whole Army of the <hi>Welch</hi> to conſiſt but of that number. But both Armies having layn for certain Days in that poſture, and the River <hi>Tywy</hi> being betwixt them; <hi>Gruffydh,</hi> by reaſon that Proviſion began to grow ſcarce in his Camp, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back; and then the Earl decamped, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Cilgerran,</hi> where he began to build a very ſtrong Caſtle. But before he could have time to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, he received an Expreſs from the King, with orders to come to him; and ſo he went by Sea to <hi>London,</hi> leaving his Army at <hi>Cilgerran,</hi> to continue the Work which he had begun. Shortly after, the King, together with the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> came to <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and ſending for Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> thither, they had good hopes to adjuſt all Differences, and to make an amicable Compoſition betwixt him and the Earl. But when this could not be effected, both Parties ſticking cloſe to their private Intereſt; the Earl being aſſiſted by the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Pyggot</hi> Lord of <hi>Ewyas,</hi> deſigned to paſs by Land to <hi>Pembrock;</hi> but his purpoſe being diſcovered to the Prince, he detached his Son to ſecure the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Carnwylhion,</hi> and came in perſon to <hi>Mabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dryd;</hi> which when the Earl underſtood, finding it dangerous to proſecute his Deſign any further, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>England;</hi> and then the Prince marched to

                  <hi>Welch;</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> having raiſed a great Army, was reſolved to make a violent Proſecution of the Earl of <hi>Pembrock</hi>'s Quarrel, againſt the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and if poſſible, to make all that Country, for ever ſubject to the Crown of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo being advanced into the Marches, he encamped at <hi>Ceri.</hi> Prince <hi>Lhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welyn</hi> on the other hand, being informed of theſe mighty Preparations in <hi>England,</hi> and underſtanding that they were intended againſt him, did uſe all the Endeavours poſſible, to make a vigorous Reſiſtance; and having drawn together all the Forces he was able to levy, thought it his wiſeſt way to meet the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon the Marches, and not to permit the Enemy to enter his Country. Both Armies being come in ſight of each other, frequent Skirmiſhes happened betwixt 'em; but one day, almoſt the whole Armies engaged, and after a vigorous Attack of both ſides, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at laſt got the worſt, and were forced to retire, having a great many Men ſlain and taken Priſoners.

But King <hi>Henry</hi> finding that his Army was worſted in this Rencounter, thought it beſt to make Peace with the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> which being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> came to the King, and having paid him all other Reſpects, beſides that of Submiſſion and Allegiance, he returned in great Honour to <hi>North-Wales.</hi> But this Action is ſomewhat otherwiſe laid

The <hi>Welch</hi> receiving intelligence of this, came preſently upon him in great Numbers, and ſurprizing the Enemies, being buſie at their Labour, forced as many as could eſcape, to betake themſelves for refuge into the Caſtle, which afterwards, having firſt caſt a deep Trench about it, they ſmartly inveſted. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Then, the reſt of his Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arrived, he marched into the Wood, which was Five Miles in length, and by reaſon of the thickneſs of the growth impaſſable; and for an eaſie paſſage through it, cauſed it to be burnt down. After that, he led his Army farther into the Country, and coming to an Abby called <hi>Cridia,</hi> which the <hi>Welch</hi> were wont to take for refuge, he cauſed it to be burnt down; but finding it a very convenient place for a Fortreſs, he granted leave to <hi>Hubert de Burgh</hi> to build a Caſtle there. But whilſt the Work was going on, the <hi>Welch-men</hi> gauled the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and skirmiſhed with them frequently, ſo that many were ſlain on both ſides; but at laſt <hi>William Bruce,</hi> with many others that went abroad to fetch Proviſion, was intercepted by the <hi>Welch,</hi> and taken Priſoner, and moſt of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were ſlain, among whom, one who was knighted a few days before, ſeeing ſome of his Fellows in great danger, ruſhed boldly into the midſt of his Enemies, and after a manful defence, bravely loſt his Life. Several of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Men were corrupted by Prince <hi>Lhewelyn,</hi> and upon that account took no great pains to repulſe the Enemy; which when the King perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

But the King of <hi>England</hi> was reſolved to retrieve the Honour he had loſt in the late Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the <hi>Welch;</hi> and therefore being returned from <hi>France,</hi> whither he had made a Deſcent, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover what his Father had loſt in that Kingdom, he came to <hi>Wales;</hi> and having remained ſome time in the Marches, he returned again to <hi>England,</hi> leaving his Army under the command of <hi>Hubert Burgh,</hi> Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> to defend the Marches againſt any in-road which the <hi>Welch</hi> might attempt.

But the King, who was very deſirous of a Peace, readily conſented to what the Prince required; and therefore he iſſued out his Letters, recalling all the Nobles who were out-law'd, or otherwiſe exil'd, requiring them to appear at <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> upon <hi>Sunday</hi> next before <hi>Aſcenſion day,</hi> where they ſhould receive their Pardons, and be reſtored to their Eſtates, which the King had taken into his own hands.</p>

                  <hi>Gruffydh</hi> being acquainted with his Brothers Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and thinking that thereby he had unavoidably diſpleaſed the King of <hi>England,</hi> privately ſent to King <hi>Henry,</hi> aſſuring him, that if by Force he would deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him out of Priſon, he would not only hold his Lands for ever from him, but alſo pay him the yearly Acknowledgment of Three Hundred Marks; offering both to give his corporal Oath, and to deliver up ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Pledges for the performance of it; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to aſſiſt the King with all his Power in bringing in
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:58558:167"/> the reſt of the <hi>Welch</hi> to his ſubjection. Moreover, <hi>Gruffydh ap Madawc,</hi> Lord of <hi>Bromfield,</hi> poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the King, that in caſe he would lead an Army into <hi>Wales,</hi> to revenge the Falſity and injurious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of <hi>David,</hi> he would give him all poſſible Aid and Aſſiſtance. Indeed, King <hi>Henry,</hi> beſides this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Invitation, had no weak Pretence to come to <hi>Wales;</hi> for <hi>Richard,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> a fiery Man, had proſecuted the matter ſo warmly at <hi>Rome,</hi> that he obtained of the Pope alſo to excommunicate <hi>David,</hi> which Excommunication being denounced againſt him, his Lands were pretendedly forfeited But the King being chiefly allured with the Promiſes of the <hi>Welch</hi> in the behalf of <hi>Gruffydh,</hi> levied a very formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Army to lead to <hi>Wales;</hi> ſtrictly commanding by Proclamation, all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who owed him any Martial-Service, to repair armed to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> by the beginning of <hi>Autumn.</hi> This Rendezvouz being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly performed, the King came thither in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at the time appointed, and having regulated his Troops, and put all Matters in convenient order, he marched to <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> where he remained Fifteen Days to refreſh his Army. During his ſtay there ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Nobility became Suitors unto him on behalf of <hi>Gruffydh,</hi> whoſe Condition they deſired he would commiſerate; among whom were, <hi>Ralph</hi> Lord <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer</hi> of <hi>Wigmore, Walter Clifford, Roger de Monte Alto,</hi> Steward of <hi>Cheſter, Maelgon ap Maelgon, Mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith ap Rotpert</hi> Lord of <hi>Cydewen, Gruffydh ap Madawc</hi> of <hi>Bromfield, Howel</hi> and <hi>Meredith</hi> the Sons of <hi>Conan ap Owen Gwynedh,</hi> and <hi>Gruffydh ap Gwenwynwyn</hi> Lord of <hi>Powys.</hi> Theſe Noblemen prevailed ſo far with King <hi>Henry,</hi> that a League was concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and <hi>Senena</hi> the Wife of <hi>Gruffydh.</hi>

But in fine, conſidering with himſelf what a puiſſant Army King <hi>Henry</hi> brought againſt him, and how himſelf was conſiderably weakened by the defection of his Subjects, he thought it moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable to truckle to the King; and therefore with all ſpeed ſent him his Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>

                  </note>Prince <hi>David</hi> having given a plenary Submiſſion to the King, deſired, that being his Nephew, and the lawful Heir and Succeſſor of his Father Prince <hi>Lhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welyn,</hi> he ſhould enjoy the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Gruffydh,</hi> who was illegitimate, and in no wiſe related to the King; aſſuring him further, that the War would never be at an end, if he was ſet at liberty. King <hi>Henry</hi> knowing well the truth of all this, and withal being aſſured that <hi>Gruffydh</hi> was not only valiant himſelf, but had likewiſe very powerful Abettors and Promoters of his Cauſe, was very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to aſſent to <hi>David</hi>'s Requeſt, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any farther Troubles, willingly granted it. Therefore <hi>David</hi> in a while after ſent his Brother <hi>Gruffydh</hi> to the King, together with the Pledges pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed for the performance of the Articles lately agreed upon; who were all ſent to the Tower of <hi>London</hi> to be kept in ſafe cuſtody; <hi>Gruffydh</hi> being allowed a Noble a day to provide himſelf with Neceſſaries. Shortly after, <hi>David</hi> came himſelf to <hi>London,</hi> and after he had done his Homage, and ſworn Fealty to the King of <hi>England,</hi> returned to <hi>Wales,</hi> being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:58558:168"/> and peaceably diſmiſſed. But as ſoon as <hi>Gruffydh</hi> found out King <hi>Henry</hi>'s mind, and that it was the leaſt part of his deſign to ſet him at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, having flatly denyed the Biſhop of <hi>Bangor</hi> his requeſt therein; he began to ſet his Brains a working, and to deviſe a means whereby he might make his eſcape out of the Tower. Whereupon, having one night deceived his Keepers, he let himſelf down from the top of the Building, by a Line which he had compoſed out of the Sheets and Hangings of the Room; which being too weak to bear his weight, being a heavy corpulent Perſon, let him down head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ground; by the greatneſs of which Fall he was cruſhed to pieces, and ſo preſently expired. King <hi>Henry</hi> being informed of this unhappy Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſeverely puniſhed the Officers for their inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Careleſneſs; and ordered that his Son, who was kept Priſoner with him in the Tower, ſhould be more narrowly obſerved.</p>
               <p>After this King <hi>Henry</hi> fortified the Caſtle of <hi>Dyſerth</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire;</hi> and for their paſſed Service, or rather to oblige them to the like after, granted to <hi>Gruffydh ap Gwenwynwyn</hi> all his Eſtate in <hi>Powys,</hi> and to the Sons of <hi>Conan ap Owen Gwynedh</hi> their Lands in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rionyth.</hi> And the next Year <hi>Maelgon Fychan</hi> fortifyed <label type="milestone">

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">A.D. </seg>1243</label> an Army into <hi>Wales,</hi> and began very unreaſonably to moleſt the <hi>Welch,</hi> and without any juſt pretence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly to ſeize upon their Lands and Eſtates. Indeed, after the death of <hi>Gruffydh,</hi> he had a mind no longer to keep his Promiſe to <hi>David,</hi> and therefore entitled his eldeſt Son <hi>Edward</hi> to the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> whom he thought to oblige the <hi>Welch</hi> to obey. But Prince <hi>David</hi> underſtanding his deſign, levyed all his Power for the defence of his juſt Right; yet finding himſelf unable to withſtand the Army of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> purpoſed to effect that by Policy which he could not attain by Force. He ſent therefore to the Pope,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:58558:169"/> complaining how that King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>England</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him unjuſtly to hold his Lands of him, and that upon no legal pretence he ſeized the Eſtates of the <hi>Welch</hi> at his pleaſure; telling him moreover, that Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> his Father had left him and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality of <hi>Wales</hi> to the Protection of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> to which he was willing to pay the yearly Sum of Five Hundred Marks, obliging himſelf and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors by Oath, for the due performance of this Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Pope (you may be ſure) gladly accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Offer, and thereupon gave commiſſion to the two Abbots of <hi>Aberconwey</hi> and <hi>Cymer,</hi> to abſolve <hi>David</hi> from his Oath of Allegiance to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and having enquired into the whole Eſtate of the Quarrel, to tranſmit an account of it to him.

               <p>But <hi>Rhys Fychan</hi> was not ſatisfied with the loſs of <hi>Buelht,</hi> and therefore was reſolved to try ro recover it; to which end, he went to the King of <hi>England,</hi> of whom he obtained a very ſtrong Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by one <hi>Stephen Bacon,</hi> which being ſent by Sea, landed at <hi>Caermardhyn</hi> in the <hi>Whitſun</hi>-Week.
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:58558:173"/> From thence the <hi>Engliſh</hi> marched to <hi>Dynefawr,</hi> and laid Siege to the Caſtle, which valiantly held out, until <hi>Lhewelyn</hi>'s Army came to its Relief. Upon the arrival of the <hi>Welch,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> decamped from before the Caſtle, and put themſelves in poſture of Battel, which the <hi>Welch</hi> perceiving, they made all haſte to anſwer and oppoſe them.

After this the Prince's Army paſſed to <hi>Dyfed,</hi> where having burnt all the Country, and deſtroyed the Caſtles of <hi>Abercorran, Lhanſtephan, Maenclochoc</hi> and <hi>Arberth,</hi> with all the Towns thereunto belonging, returned to <hi>North-Wales</hi> with much Spoil. But as ſoon as he was arrived, great Complaints were exhibited to Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> againſt <hi>Jeffrey Langley</hi> Lieutenant to <hi>Edward</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> who without any regard to Equity and Conſcience, moſt wrongfully oppreſſed the Inhabitants of <hi>Wales</hi> under his Juriſdiction.

But finding him too ſtrong, he thought it more adviſable to deſiſt from Hoſtility, the Prince's Army conſiſting of Ten Thouſand experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Men, who were obliged by Oath, rather all to die in the Field, than ſuffer the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to gain any Advantage over the <hi>Welch.</hi> But <hi>Gruffydh ap Madoc Maelor,</hi> Lord of <hi>Dinas Brân,</hi> a Perſon of notorious Reputation for Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, baſely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook

And though the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> be under the immediate Protection of the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet, when his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs comes to underſtand of the great and unſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable Wrongs done to him by the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> how the Articles of Peace were broken, Churches and all other religious Houſes in <hi>Wales</hi> were burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down and deſtroyed, and religious Perſons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly murthered, he hoped he would rather pity and lament his Condition, than with addition of Puniſhment increaſe and augment his Sorrow. Neither ſhall the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> be any wiſe diſquieted and moleſted by his means, in caſe the Peace be religiouſly obſerved towards him and his Subjects.

<pb n="289" facs="tcp:58558:181"/> Author of which unworthy Action he did not pretend to maintain, but would inflict upon him his condign Puniſhment, in caſe he could be got out of the Woods and Deſarts, where as an Outlaw, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

But as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencing a War in a Seaſon inconvenient, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he knew nothing of that till now; yet thoſe that did ſo, do ſolemnly atteſt that to be the only meaſure they had to ſave themſelves, and that they had no other ſecurity for their Lives and Fortunes, than to keep themſelves in Arms. Concerning his Sins and Treſpaſſes againſt God, with the aſſiſtance of his Grace, he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to repent of; neither ſhould the War be willingly continued by him, in caſe he might ſave himſelf harmleſs; but before he would be unjuſtly diſpoſſeſſed of his legal Propriety, he thought it but reaſonable, by all poſſible meaſures to defend himſelf. And he was very willing, upon due Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the Treſpaſſes committed, to make Satisfaction and Retribution of all Wrongs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by him and his Subjects; ſo that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> would obſerve the ſame of their ſide; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was ready to conclude a Peace, which he thought was impoſſible to be eſtabliſhed, as long as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had no regard to Articles, and ſtill oppreſs his People with new and unwarrantable Exactions. Therefore ſeeing his Subjects were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianly abuſed by the King's Officers, and all his Country moſt tyrannically haraſſed, he ſaw no reaſon why the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> upon any fault of his ſide, ſhould threaten to bring a formidable Army to his Country, nor the Church pretend to cenſure him; ſeeing alſo, he was very willing upon the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Conditions, to ſubmit to a Peace. And laſtly, he deſired his Grace, that he would not give the more credit to his Enemies, becauſe they were near his Perſon, and could deliver their Complaints frequently, and by word of mouth; for they who made no conſcience of oppreſſing, would not in all probability, ſtick to defame, and make falſe Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations;
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:58558:182"/> and therefore his Grace would make a better Eſtimation of the whole matter, by examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Actions, rather than believing their Words.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> having to this purpoſe replyed in general to the Archbiſhops Articles, preſented him with a Copy of the ſeveral Grievances, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and others of his Subjects had wrongfully and unjuſtly received at the hands of the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And theſe, though ſomewhat tedious, are thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be particularly inſerted in the Appendix, by reaſon that they demonſtrably vindicate the <hi>Welch</hi> Nation, from the unreaſonable Aſperſions which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of theſe times caſt upon it. For, the breach of Peace, and the occaſion of thoſe diſmal Diſturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Kingdom, are, by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers of thoſe times, wholly attributed to the reſtleſs and rebellious Humour and unconſtant Temper of the <hi>Welch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Whereas, had they looked at home, they might have found the Original of all theſe Troubles, to have proceeded from the intolerable Extortions and inſupportable Oppreſſions of their own Nation. For whoever conſiders theſe unmerciful Grievances, and the manifold Wrongs the <hi>Welch</hi> endured, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in reaſon be expected, but that they would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to vindicate themſelves, and repel Force by Force. For, had the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the liberty of diſpoſſeſſing them wrongfully of their proper Inheritance and Eſtates, and it was not lawful for the <hi>Welch</hi> to endeavour the defending and keeping their own? And muſt they be reckoned diſobedient, and Promoters of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, upon the account that they would not be trampled under, and enſlaved by the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> Theſe Meaſures were too hard and intolerable, and ſcarce allowable in an Infidel Nation; to oppreſs, (and what in them lay) eradicate a People, for no other reaſon, than becauſe they were weaker and more helpleſs than themſelves; and then, what is worſe, to accuſe them of being Authors of Sedition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not ſuffer themſelves to be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably enſlaved, but endeavoured to vindicate their Right by main Force. But it is highly probable,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:58558:182"/> that King <hi>Edward</hi> had no inclination to obſerve, what Articles of Agreement ſoever were concluded upon; and therefore encouraged his Deputies in the Marches and inland Country of <hi>Wales,</hi> in all their Oppreſſions and ſiniſtrous Dealings towards the <hi>Welch.</hi> This was the beſt Method, and the moſt expedient Means to reduce the Country of <hi>Wales</hi> to ſubjection to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> which the King had long ago intentionally effected: And to accuſe the <hi>Welch</hi> of not obſerving the Conditions of Peace, was a ſpecious Pretence to bring that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to paſs, and to lead an Army into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But whaever the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might pretend, 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the <hi>Welch</hi> had the greater occaſion to complain,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> the Appendix.</note> as appears from the Grievances committed as well againſt the Prince himſelf, as others of his Subjects.</p>
               <p>The Archbiſhop having read over theſe Grievances, and finding the <hi>Welch</hi> to be upon good reaſon guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of that ſevere Character, which by the malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inſinuations of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he had conceived of them, went to King <hi>Edward;</hi> requeſting him to take into conſideration the unjuſt Wrongs and Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done to the <hi>Welch;</hi> which if he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, at leaſt he might excuſe them from any breach of Obedience to him, ſeeing they had ſo juſt a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for what they did. The King replyed, That he willingly forgave them, and would make reaſonable Satisfaction for any Wrong done; ſo that they had free acceſs to declare their Greivances before him; and then might ſafely depart, in caſe it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear juſt and lawful they ſhould. The Archbiſhop upon this thought he had obtained his purpoſe, and therefore, without any ſtay, poſted it to <hi>Snowden,</hi> where the Prince and his Brother <hi>David</hi> reſided; and having acquainted them with the King's mind, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired that they, and the reſt of the Nobility of <hi>Wales,</hi> would ſubmit themſelves, and by him be introduced to the King's preſence. Prince <hi>Lhewelyn,</hi> after ſome times Conference and Debate, declared that he was ready to ſubmit to the King, with the reſerve only of two particulars; namely, his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:58558:183"/> whereby he was obliged to regard the Safety and Liberties of his People; and then the decency of his own State and Quality. But the King under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding by the Archbiſhop, how that the Prince ſtood upon Terms, poſitively refuſed to conſent to any more Treaty of Peace, than that he ſhould ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſubmit, without any farther Conditions. The Archbiſhop had experience enough, that the <hi>Welch</hi> would never agree to ſuch Propoſals; and therefore deſired of his Majeſty, that he would give him leave, with the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility preſent, to confer and conclude upon the matter; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted, they unanimouſly reſolved upon the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Articles, and ſent them to the Prince by <hi>John Wallenſis,</hi> Biſhop of S. <hi>Davids.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. <hi>The King will have no Treaty of the four Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, and other Lands which he has beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Nobles; nor of the Iſle of</hi> Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſey.</item>

                  <item>III. <hi>We will do the like touching Prince</hi> Lhewelyn, <hi>concerning whom we can return no other An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, than that he muſt barely ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the King, without hopes of any other Conditions.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe were the publick Articles agreed upon by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, and ſent to Prince <hi>Lhewelyn;</hi> beſides which, they ſent ſome private Meaſures of Agreement, relating both to him and his Brother <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid;</hi> promiſing, that in caſe he would ſubmit, and put the King in quiet poſſeſſion of <hi>Snowden,</hi> his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would beſtow an <hi>Engliſh</hi> County upon him, with the yearly Revenue of a Thouſand Pound Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And moreover, his Daughter ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for, ſuitable to her Birth and Quality, and all
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:58558:183"/> his Subjects according to their Eſtate and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and in caſe he ſhould have Male Iſſue by a ſecond Wife, the aforeſaid County and a Thouſand Pound ſhould remain to his Poſterity for ever. As for <hi>David</hi> the Prince's Brother, if he would conſent to go to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> upon condition not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn but upon the King's Pleaſure, all things ſhould be honourably prepared for his Journey with reſpect to his Quality; and his Child maintain'd and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for by the King. To theſe the Archbiſhop added his Threats; That in caſe they did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and ſubmit themſelves to the King's Mercy, there were very ſevere and imminent Dangers hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their Heads; a formidable Army was ready to make an inroad into their Country, which would not only gaul and oppreſs them, but in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility totally eradicate the whole Nation: Beſides which, they were to expect the ſevereſt Cenſure and Puniſhment of the Church.</p>
               <p>But all this could not force ſo unlimited a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the Prince, but that he would ſtick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome certain Conditions; and therefore by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he acquainted the Archbiſhop, <q rend="margQuotes">That he was with all willingneſs deſirous to ſubmit himſelf to the King; but withal, that he could not do it but in ſuch a manner as was ſafe and honeſt for him. And becauſe the Form of Submiſſion contained in the Articles ſent to him, were by himſelf and his Council thought pernicious and illegal for him to conſent to as tending rather to the Deſtruction, than the Security of himſelf and his Subjects, he could in no wiſe agree to it; and in caſe himſelf ſhould be willing, the reſt of his Nobility and People would never admit of it, as knowing for certain the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and Inconveniency that would enſue thereby. Therefore he deſired his Lordſhip, that for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of an honeſt and a durable Peace, which he had all this while earneſtly laboured for, he would manage Matters circumſpectly, and with due regard to the following Articles. For it was much more honourable for the King, and far more
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:58558:184"/> conſonant to Reaſon, that he ſhould hold his Lands in the Country where he was born and dwelt in, than that by diſpoſſeſſing of him, his Eſtate ſhould be beſtowed upon Strangers.</q> With this was ſent the general Anſwer of the <hi>Welch</hi> to the Archbiſhop's Articles, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Though the King would not conſent to treat of the four Cantreds, nor of the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey;</hi> yet unleſs theſe be comprehended in the Treaty, the Prince's Council will not conclude a Peace; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that theſe Cantreds have ever, ſince the time of <hi>Camber</hi> the Son of <hi>Brutus,</hi> properly and legally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Princes of <hi>Wales;</hi> beſides the Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which the preſent Prince obtained by the Conſent of the King and his Father, at the Treaty before Cardinal <hi>Ottobonus</hi> the Pope's Legate, whoſe Letters Patents do ſtill appear. And more, the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the thing it ſelf is plainly evident, that it is more reaſonable for our Heirs to hold the ſaid Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds for Money, and other Services due to the King, than that Strangers enjoy the ſame, who will forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abuſe and oppreſs the People.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the Tenants of the Cantreds of <hi>Wales</hi> do unanimouſly declare, that they dare not ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the King's Pleaſure; by reaſon that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from the beginning took care to obſerve either Covenant, Oath, or any other Grant to the Prince and his People; and becauſe his Subjects have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Religion, but moſt cruelly and unchriſtianly tyranize over Churches and religious Perſons; and then, for that we do not underſtand our ſelves any way obliged thereunto, ſeeing we be the Princes Tenants, who is willing to pay the King all uſual and accuſtomed Services.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to what is required, that the Prince ſhould ſimply commit himſelf to the King's Will, we all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that for the aforeſaid Reaſons, none of us dare come, neither will we permit our Prince to come to him upon thoſe Conditions.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:58558:184"/>4. That ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to procure a proviſion of a Thouſand Pounds a Year in <hi>England;</hi> we would let them know, that we can accept of no ſuch Penſion; becauſe it is procured for no other end, than that the Prince being diſinherited, themſelves may obtain his Lands in <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The Prince cannot in honeſty reſign his pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Inheritance, which has for many Ages been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by his Predeceſſours, and accept of other Lands among the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> of whoſe Cuſtoms and Language he is ignorant; and upon that ſcore, may at length be fraudulently deprived of all, by his malicious and inveterate Enemies.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Seeing the King intends to deprive him of his antient Inheritance in <hi>Wales,</hi> where the Land is more barren and untilled; it is not very probable that he will beſtow upon him, a more fruitful and an a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>able Eſtate in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. As to the Clauſe, that the Prince ſhould give the King a perpetual Poſſeſſion of <hi>Snowden;</hi> we only affirm, that ſeeing <hi>Snowden</hi> eſſentially belongs to the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> which the Prince and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors have enjoyed ſince <hi>Brute,</hi> the Prince's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil will not permit him to renounce it, and accept another Eſtate in <hi>England,</hi> to which he has not equal Right.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The People of <hi>Snowden</hi> declare, That though the Prince ſhould give the King poſſeſſion of it, they would never own, and pay Submiſſion to Strangers; for in ſo doing, they would bring upon themſelves the ſame Miſery, that the People of the Four Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds have for a long time groaned under; being moſt rudely handled and unjuſtly oppreſſed by the King's Officers; as wofully appears by their ſeveral Grievances.</p>
               <p n="9">9. As for <hi>David,</hi> the Prince's Brother, we ſee no reaſon, why againſt his Will he ſhould be compell'd to take a Journey to the <hi>Holy-Land;</hi> which if he happens to undertake hereafter upon the account of Religion, it is no cauſe that his Iſſue ſhould be diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited, but rather encouraged.</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:58558:185"/>
               <p>Now ſeeing neither the Prince nor any of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects upon any account whatſoever, have moved and begun this War, but only defended themſelves, their Properties, Laws, and Liberties, from the Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of other Perſons; and ſince the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> for either Malice or Covetouſneſs to obtain our Eſtates, have unjuſtly occaſioned all theſe Troubles and Broils in the Kingdom, we are aſſured that our Defence is juſt and lawful, and therein depend upon the Aid and Aſſiſtance of Heaven; which will be moſt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revenged upon our ſacrilegious and inhumane Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who have left no manner of Enormities, in relation to God and Man, uncommitted. Therefore your Grace would more juſtly threaten your Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Cenſures, againſt the Authors and Abettors of ſuch unparallell'd Villanies, than the innocent Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers. And beſides, we much admire, that you ſhould adviſe us to part with our own Eſtates, and to live among our Enemies; as if, when we cannot peaceably enjoy what is our own unqueſtionable Right, we might expect to have quiet poſſeſſion of another Mans: And though, as you ſay, it be hard to live in War and perpetual Danger; yet much harder it is, to be utterly deſtroyed and reduced to nothing; eſpecially, when we ſeek but the Defence of our own Liberties from the inſatiable Ambition of our Enemies. And ſeeing your Grace has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to fulminate Sentence againſt all them that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Malice or Profit would hinder and obſtruct the Peace; it is evident who in this reſpect are Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors and Delinquents; the fear and apprehenſion of Impriſonment and Ejection out of our Eſtates, the ſenſe of Oppreſſion and tyrannical Government, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compell'd us to take up Arms for the ſecurity of our Lives and Fortunes. Therefore as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are not diſpoſeſſed of their Eſtates, for their Offences againſt the King, ſo we are willing to be puniſhed, or make other Satisfaction for our Crimes, without being diſinherited; and as to the breach of the Peace, 'tis notorious that they were the Authors, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver regarded either Promiſe or Covenant, never
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:58558:185"/> made Amends for Treſpaſſes, nor Remedy for our Complaints.</p>
               <p>When the Archbiſhop ſaw there was no likelihood of a Mediation, and that a Peace was impoſſible to be concluded as long as the <hi>Welch</hi> ſtuck upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; he preſently relinquiſhed his pretended Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards them, and denounced a Sentence of Excommunication againſt the Prince and all his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. It was a ſubject of no little wonder, that a Perſon of ſo reputed a Sanctity, who eſteemed the ſeveral Grievances done to the <hi>Welch</hi> to be intoler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſhould now condemn them for refuſal of unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited Submiſſion to the King of <hi>England;</hi> whereas he had already owned it to be unreaſonable. But this eccleſiaſtical Cenſure was only a Prologue to a more melancholy Scene; King <hi>Edward</hi> immediately upon it, ſending an Army by Sea to <hi>Angleſey,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great Oppoſition, conquered the Iſland, and without any Mercy, put all that withſtood him to the Sword. From thence deſigning to paſs over to the Continent, he cauſed a Bridg of Boats covered with Planks to be built over the <hi>Menay</hi> (being an Arm of the Sea which parteth the Iſle from the main Land) at a place called <hi>Moel y don,</hi> not far from <hi>Bangor,</hi> where the Water is narroweſt. The Bridg being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, which was ſo broad as that Threeſcore Men might paſs in a breaſt, <hi>William Latimer,</hi> with a ſtrong Party of the beſt experienced Soldiers, and Sir <hi>Lucas Thany,</hi> Commander of the <hi>Gaſcoigns</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whereof a great number ſerved the King, paſſed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but could diſcover no ſign, or any the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of an Enemy. But as ſoon as the Tide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to appear, and the Sea had overflown beſide the Bridg, down come the <hi>Welch</hi> fiercely out of the Mountains, and ſetting upon the diſheartned <hi>Engliſh,</hi> killed or drowned their whole number, excepting <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer,</hi> who by the ſwimming of his Horſe got ſafe to the Bridg In this Action, ſeveral worthy Soldiers of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſide were loſt; among whom were Sir <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas Thany, Robert Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Lyndſey,</hi> two Brothers of <hi>Robert Burnel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bath,</hi> with many
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:58558:186"/> others; in all to the number of Thirteen Knights, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen young Gentlemen, and Two Hundred com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers. A little after, or as ſome ſay afore, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Engagement paſſed between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Welch,</hi> wherein the former loſt Fourteen Colours, the Lords <hi>Audley</hi> and <hi>Clifford</hi> the younger being ſlain, and the King himſelf forced to retreat for ſafety to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of <hi>Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And while theſe things paſſed in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter</hi> and Sir <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> acted vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly with their Forces in <hi>South-Wales;</hi> and fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Welch</hi> at <hi>Lhandeilo Fawr,</hi> overthrew them, with the loſs of no conſiderable Perſon, ſaving <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Valence</hi> the King's Coſin-German, and Four Knights beſides. Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> was all this while in <hi>Cardigan,</hi> a waſting and deſtroying all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and principally the Lands of <hi>Rhys ap Meredith,</hi> who very unnaturally held with the King of <hi>England</hi> in all theſe Wars. But being at length tired with Action, with a few Men privately ſeparated himſelf from his Army, and came to <hi>Buelht,</hi> thinking to eaſe and reſpit himſelf there undiſcovered. But coming to the River <hi>Wye,</hi> he met with <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> and <hi>John Gifford,</hi> with a conſiderable Party of the People of that Country, which <hi>Mortimer</hi> was Lord of. But neither Party venturing to aſſail the other, Prince <hi>Lhewelyn</hi> with one only Servant retired to a private Grove in a neighbouring Valley, there to conſult with certain Lords of the Country, who had appointed to meet him. In the mean time <hi>Mortimer</hi> deſcends from the Hill, with intention to fall upon <hi>Lhewelyn</hi>'s Men; which they perceiving, betook themſelves to the Bridg called <hi>Pont Orewyn,</hi> and manfully defended the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he was to croſs. <hi>Mortimer</hi> could effect nothing againſt them, till he had gained the Bridg, the River being unpaſſable; and to force them to quit it, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed altogether impracticable. But at laſt, the River was diſcovered to be fordable a little below, and ſo <hi>Helias Walwyn</hi> was detached with a Party through the River, who unexpectedly falling upon the backs of the Defendants, eaſily forced them to leave the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:58558:186"/> Bridg, and ſave themſelves by flight. Prince <hi>Lhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welyn</hi> all this while in vain expected the Lords of <hi>Buelht,</hi> and in fine continued to wait ſo long, till <hi>Mortimer</hi> having paſſed over the Bridg, ſurrounded the Wood he was in with armed Men. The Prince perceiving himſelf to be betrayed, thought to make his eſcape to his Men; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſo cloſely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him, that before he could come in, one <hi>Adam Francton,</hi> not knowing who he was, run him through with his Sword, being unarmed. The <hi>Welch</hi> ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected the arrival of their Prince, and though but a few in number, ſo gallantly maintained their ground, that in ſpight of the far greater number of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they were at length with much ado put to flight. The Battel being over, <hi>Francton</hi> returned to plunder his dead; but perceiving him to be the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> he thought himſelf to have obtained a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prize, and thereupon preſently chopt off his Head, and ſent it to King <hi>Edward</hi> at <hi>Conwey,</hi> who very joyfully cauſed it to be placed upon the higheſt Pinacle of the Tower of <hi>London.</hi> And thus fell this worthy Prince, the greateſt, though the laſt of the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Blood, betrayed moſt baſely by the Lords of <hi>Buelht,</hi> and being dead, moſt unworthily dealt with by the King of <hi>England;</hi> who contrary to all Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, treated a lawful Prince like a Traytor, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his crowned Head to the Deriſion of the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
               <p>Not long after, <hi>David</hi> the Prince's Brother was delivered up by the <hi>Welch</hi> themſelves, and in a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament for that purpoſe aſſembled at <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> was condemned to dye; his Head to be ſent to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny his Brothers upon the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and his four Quarters to the four Cities of <hi>Briſtol, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hampton, York,</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter.</hi> Then the King for the eaſier keeping the <hi>Welch</hi> in due ſubjection, built Two ſtrong Caſtles in <hi>North Wales;</hi> the one at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wey</hi> and the other at <hi>Caernarvon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Glyndwr</hi> therefore perceiving how his Petition was ſlighted in Parliament, and finding no other method to redreſs himſelf, having ſeveral Friends and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, put himſelf in Arms againſt <hi>Reginald,</hi> and meeting him in the Field, overcame and took him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, and ſpoiled his Lordſhip of <hi>Rhuthyn.</hi> Upon this many reſorted to him from all parts of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſome thinking him to be in as great Favour now, as in King <hi>Richard</hi>'s days, others putting in his head, that now the time was come when the <hi>Britains</hi> by his means might again recover the Honor and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their Anceſtors.

Year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, and to deliver up his eldeſt Son with ſome other Perſons of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as Hoſtages for the remainder; the King at the humble ſute of <hi>Reginald,</hi> ſeeing no other way for his enlargement, gave way thereto, authorizing Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Roos,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard de Grey,</hi> Sir <hi>William de Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby,</hi> Sir <hi>William le Zouche,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Huls,</hi> as alſo, <hi>John Harvey, William Vaus, John Lee, John Langford, Thomas Payne,</hi> and <hi>John Elneſtow,</hi> to treat with <hi>Owen</hi> and his Council, and to conclude in what they ſhould conceive moſt expedient and neceſſary to be done for his redemption. Whereupon they conſenting to give the ſum demanded by <hi>Glyndwr</hi> for his deliverance, the King gave Licenſe to <hi>Robert Braybroke</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> as alſo to Sir <hi>Gerard Braybroke</hi> the Father, and Sir <hi>Gerard</hi> the Son, then Feoffees of divers Lordſhips for this <hi>Reginald,</hi> to ſell the Mannor of <hi>Hertelegh</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> towards the raiſing of that
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:58558:195"/> Money. And for the better enabling him to pay ſo great a Fine, the King was pleaſed to grant, that whereas it was enacted, that ſuch Perſons who were owners of Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and did not there reſide, ſhould for ſuch their neglect, forfeit two parts of the Profits of them to the King; that notwithſtanding this Act, he ſhould forfeit nothing for non-reſidence there, during the term of ſix years next enſuing.</p>
               <p>This good Succeſs over the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> together with the numerous reſort of the <hi>Welch</hi> to him, and the favourable interpretations of the Prophecies of <hi>Merdhyn,</hi> which ſome conſtrued very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſſy, made the ſwelling mind of <hi>Glyndwr</hi> over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow its Banks, and gave him ſome hopes of reſtoring this Iſland back to the <hi>Britains.</hi> Wherefore he ſet upon the Earl of <hi>March,</hi> who met him with a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous party of <hi>Hereford-ſhire</hi> Men, but when they came to cloſe, the <hi>Welch</hi>-men proved too powerful, and having killed above a Thouſand Men of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> they took the Earl of <hi>March</hi> Priſoner. King <hi>Henry</hi> upon this was frequently requeſted to Ranſom the Earl, but to no purpoſe; for whether by reaſon that <hi>Mortimer</hi> had a juſter Title to the Crown than himſelf, he being the next Heir in Blood after King <hi>Richard,</hi> who was as yet living, or becauſe of ſome other private <hi>odium,</hi> the King would never hearken to his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, alledging that he wilfully threw himſelf into the hands of <hi>Glyndwr.</hi> But about the midſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to correct the preſumptuous Attempts of the <hi>Welch,</hi> the King went in Perſon with a great Army into <hi>Wales;</hi> but by reaſon of extraordinary exceſs of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which ſome attributed to the Magic of <hi>Glyndwr,</hi> he was glad to return ſafe.</p>
               <p>But the Earl of <hi>March</hi> perceiving that he was not like to obtain his Liberty by King <hi>Henry</hi>'s means, whether out of compliance, by reaſon of his tedious Captivity, or Affection to the young Lady, he agreed to take part with <hi>Owen</hi> againſt the King of <hi>England,</hi> and to marry his Daughter; with them joyned the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and his Brother the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> with his Son the valiant Lord <hi>Percy,</hi> who

After that they exhibited Articles of their Grievances to King <hi>Henry,</hi> and divulged their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for taking up Arms; at length they marched with all their Power towards <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> to fight the King, depending mainly upon the arrival of <hi>Glyndwr</hi> and his <hi>Welch-men.</hi> But the matter was gone ſo far, that whether he came in or no, they muſt fight, and ſo both Armies being joyned, the King's Party prevailed, young <hi>Percy</hi> being ſlain upon the ſpot, and <hi>Douglas,</hi> beſides moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of Quality, who with a Party of <hi>Scotch</hi> had come to the Aid of the Confederates, was taken Priſoner, but afterwards honourably ſet at Liberty by the Interceſſion of the Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> In the mean time the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was a marching forward with a great Party from the <hi>North,</hi> but the King having ſettled Matters about <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> coming to <hi>York,</hi> and ſending to him to lay down his Arms, he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſubmitted and diſmiſſed his Forces. Then the King returning from <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> determined to paſs over to <hi>North-Wales,</hi> to chaſtiſe the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Practices of the immorigerous <hi>Welch,</hi> who after his departure from <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> had made in-Roads into the Marches, and done much hurt to his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subjects. But other Buſineſs of greater Conſequence intervening, he detached his Son the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who took the Caſtle of <hi>Aberyſtwyth,</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:58558:196"/> which was quickly again retaken by <hi>Owen Glyndwr,</hi> who thruſt into it a ſtrong Garriſon of <hi>Welch.</hi> But <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

After this, we hear little of <hi>Glyndwr,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting that he continued and perſiſted to vex and plague the <hi>Engliſh</hi> upon the Marches, to the tenth year of King <hi>Henry</hi>'s reign, when he miſerably ended his life; being as <hi>Holingſhed</hi> reporteth,<note place="margin">Holinſ.</note> towards his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But theſe rebellious Practices of <hi>Glyndwr,</hi> highly exaſperated King <hi>Henry</hi> againſt the <hi>Welch,</hi> inſomuch that ſeveral rigorous and unmerciful Laws were enacted, relating to <hi>Wales,</hi> which in effect deſtroyed all the Liberties of the <hi>Welch</hi> Subject. They were made incapable of purchaſing any Lands, or to be elected Members of any County or Burrough, and to undertake any Office, whether Civil or Military in any Town incorporated. If any Suit at Law happened betwixt an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man and a <hi>Welch</hi> Man, the former could not be convicted, but by the Sentence of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Judge, and the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jury; beſides, that any <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Man who married a <hi>Welch</hi> Woman, was thereby forthwith diſfranchiſed from all the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Subject. It was farther enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that no <hi>Welch</hi> Man ſhould be in poſſeſſion of any Caſtle, or other place of Strength, and that no Victuals or Armour ſhould be brought into <hi>Wales,</hi> without a ſpecial Warrant from the King or his Council; and farther, that no <hi>Welch</hi> Man was capable of undertaking the Office of Juſtice, Chamberlain, Sheriff or any other place of Truſt in any part of <hi>Wales,</hi> notwithſtanding any Patent
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:58558:197"/> or Licenſe heretofore given to the contrary. Theſe, with many others moſt rigorous and unjuſt Laws, particularly that forbidding any <hi>Welch</hi> Man to bring up his Children to Learning, or to bind them Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices to any Trade or Occupation, were enacted by the King againſt the <hi>Welch;</hi> ſo that nothing could cool his diſpleaſure, but that a whole Nation ſhould be wrongfully oppreſſed, for the fault and miſcarriage of one Perſon. But one might think, that this was no politick method to ſecure a Nation in its Allegiance, which upon lighter Affronts was uſed to defend its Priviledges; and therefore we may well attribute the quiet diſpoſition of the <hi>Welch</hi> towards this time, to the moderation of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth, who within a little time ſucceeded his Father in the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>

But being informed that his Maſter <hi>Richard</hi> was depoſed and murdered, and withal being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by ſeveral Wrongs and Affronts done him by his Neighbour the Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Rhuthyn,</hi> whom King <hi>Henry</hi> greatly countenanced, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Henry</hi> as an Uſurper, he cauſed himſelf to be proclaimed Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> And for a better grace of the matter, he feigned himſelf to be deſcended by a Daughter from <hi>Lhewelyn ap Gruffydh</hi> the laſt Prince; whereas in truth, he came Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally but from a younger Brother of the Houſe of <hi>Powys.</hi> But as Ambition has no moderation, ſo <hi>Glyndwr</hi> for a time acted the part of a Prince, and ſummoned a Parliament to meet at <hi>Machynlleth,</hi> whither the Nobility and Gentry of <hi>Wales</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,

                  <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> the ſole Iſſue of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Prince King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, by <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Rayner</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and titular King of <hi>Jeruſalem, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Arragon;</hi> was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> in a Parliament held at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> on the 15th day of <hi>March,</hi> in the Thirty Second Year of his Fathers Reign. When the Day was loſt at <hi>Tewksbury,</hi> this young Prince thought to make his eſcape by flight, but being unfortunately taken, and brought to the preſence of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, who then ſat upon the Helm, made ſuch reſolute and unexpected Replies, that he put the King to ſuch a paſſion, that he ſmote him on the Mouth with his Gauntlet; and then his Brother <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Crouch-back, ran him into the Heart with his Dagget.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward,</hi> born in the Sanctuary at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the eldeſt Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, was, after his Fathers Expulſion out of <hi>England,</hi> in the Fourty Ninth Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, created Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in the Eleventh Year of his Fathers Reign. Upon the death of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, this young Prince being then at <hi>Ludlow</hi> in the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> was preſently ſent for to <hi>London,</hi> and proclaimed King of <hi>England,</hi> but never liv'd to be crowned; for his Uncle <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> who was appointed his Protector, moſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainouſly made him away, together with his Brother the Duke of <hi>York;</hi> and afterwards was himſelf pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and crowned King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth, in his Wars againſt <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, was very much aſſiſted by the <hi>Welch;</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of which Service, he deſign'd to reform Matters ſo in <hi>Wales,</hi> as that intolerable Oppreſſion which they had hitherto endured, ſhould be regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and taken off. And to that end, he meant to eſtabliſh a Court within the ſaid Principality, and conſtituted <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> Preſident of the Prince's Council in the <hi>Marches;</hi> who, together with <hi>Anthony</hi> Earl of <hi>Rivers,</hi> ſat in the Town-Hall of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> and conſtituted certain Ordinances for
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:58558:199"/> the publick Good and Tranquility of that place. But the matter proceeded no farther; for the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Diſquietneſs of his Kingdom, coming heavy upon him, and the ſhortneſs of his Reign after his Eſtabliſhment not permitting, he was forced to leave that to others, which himſelf thought once to bring about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward,</hi> born at <hi>Middleham</hi> near <hi>Richmond</hi> in the County of <hi>York</hi> the only Son of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, was at Ten Years of Age created by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and dyed ſoon after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Arthur,</hi> the eldeſt Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, born at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> was in the Seventh Year of his Fathers Reign created Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> About the Fifteenth Year of his Age, being then newly married to <hi>Katherine</hi> the Infanta of <hi>Spain,</hi> he was ſent by his Father into <hi>Wales,</hi> that by his preſence he might keep that Country in better awe. With him King <hi>Henry</hi> ſent Dr. <hi>William Smith,</hi> afterwards made Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, being by his Grandfather <hi>Owen Tudor</hi> deſcended out of <hi>Wales,</hi> and having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently experienced the Affection of the <hi>Welch</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him; firſt, of thoſe, who upon his firſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

And therefore this prudent Prince, finding the Calamities of the <hi>Welch</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, and ſeeing what grievous and unmerciful Laws were enacted againſt them by his Predeceſſours, he took occaſion to redreſs and reform the ſame, and granted to the <hi>Welch</hi> a Charter of Liberty and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, whereby they were releaſed from the cruel Oppreſſion, which ſince their Subjection to the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Government, they had moſt cruelly ſuſtained. And ſeeing the Birth and Quality of his Grandfather <hi>Owen Tudor</hi> was called in queſtion, and that he was by many upbraided of being of a mean and ignoble Parentage; King <hi>Henry</hi> directed a Commiſſion to the Abbot of <hi>Lhan Egweſt,</hi> Dr. <hi>Owen Pool</hi> Canon of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford,</hi> and <hi>John King</hi> Herald at Arms, to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition concerning the Pedigree of the ſaid <hi>Owen;</hi> who coming to <hi>Wales,</hi> made a diligent enquiry into this matter; and by the aſſiſtance of Sir <hi>John Leyaf, Guttyn Owen Bardh, Gruffydh ap Lhewelyn ap Efan Fychan,</hi> and others, in the conſultation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Books of Pedegrees, they drew up an exact Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of <hi>Owen Tudor,</hi> which upon their return,<note place="margin">Vide Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Edward,</hi> Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, by the Lady <hi>Jane Seymour,</hi> his third Wife, was born at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> on the 12th of <hi>October;</hi> and upon the 18th. of the ſaid Month, was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Cheſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, had already abrogated thoſe unreaſonable and intollerable Laws, which the former Kings of <hi>England,</hi> particularly <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, had made againſt the <hi>Welch;</hi> and now, King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, willing to make a plenary Reformation of what his Father had wiſely begun, thought it neceſſary towards the Good and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:58558:200"/> of both Nations, to make the <hi>Welch</hi> ſubject to the ſame Laws, and the ſame Government with the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> He underſtood that the uſual Hoſtilities and Depredations were ſtill continued and kept up by both ſides upon the Borders; and though his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had eaſed the Yoak of the <hi>Welch,</hi> yet he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that it did contribute but little towards the diſannulling of that inveterate and implacable Envy and Animoſity which raged in the Marches. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to remedy this, otherwiſe unavoidable, Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he concluded that it was the only effectual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, to incorporate the <hi>Welch</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> that they being ſubject to the ſame Laws, might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">A.D. </seg>1536</label> fear the Violation of them. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the Twenty Seventh Year of his Reign, an Act of Parliament paſſed to that purpoſe, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with another Act in the Thirty Fifth of his Reign, made a plenary Incorporation of the <hi>Welch</hi> with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which Union has had that bleſſed Effect, that it has diſpelled all thoſe unnatural Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which heretofore were ſo rife and irreconcilable.</p>
               <p>When the Reformation was firſt eſtabliſhed in <hi>Wales,</hi> it was a mighty Inconveniency to the vulgar People, ſuch as were unacquainted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue, that the Bible was not tranſlated into their native Language. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the Inconveniency which the <hi>Welch</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, for the want of ſuch a Tranſlation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">A.D. </seg>1566</label> in the Eighth Year of her Reign, an Act of Parliament was paſſed, whereby the Biſhops of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reford,</hi> S. <hi>Davids,</hi> S. <hi>Aſaph, Bangor,</hi> and <hi>Landaff,</hi> were ordered to take care that the Bible containing the Old and New Teſtament, with the Book of Common-Prayer, and Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be truly and exactly tranſlated into the <hi>Britiſh</hi> or <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue, and that the ſame ſo tranſlated, being by them peruſed and approved, be printed to ſuch a number at leaſt; as that every Cathedral, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate and Pariſh-Church and Chappel of eaſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid Dioceſs where that Tongue is vulgarly ſpoken, might be ſupplyed before the Firſt of <hi>March,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:58558:200"/> Anno</hi> 1566. And from that time forward, the <hi>Welch</hi> Divine Service ſhould be uſed in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Tongue, in all places throughout thoſe Dioceſſes, where the <hi>Welch</hi> is commonly ſpoke, after the ſame manner as it was uſed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; and that the Charge of procuring the ſaid Bible and Common-Prayer, ſhould equally depend betwixt the Parſon and the Pariſh; the former being obliged to pay one half of the Expence; and that the Price of the Book ſhould be ſet by the foreſaid Biſhops, or by Three of them at the leaſt. But this Act of Parliament was not punctually obſerved; for the Old Teſtament was wholly omitted, and only the New, with the Book of Common-Prayer and Adminiſtration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then tranſlated, which Tranſlation was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to <hi>Richard</hi> Biſhop of S. <hi>Davids,</hi> who was aſſiſted by <hi>William Salusbury,</hi> a Perfect Critick in the <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue, and one excellently converſant in all <hi>Britiſh</hi> Antiquities.

This was of ſingular Profit and Advantage to the <hi>Welch,</hi> to have the whole Scripture read and peruſed in their own native Tongue; by which means they received a clearer demonſtration of the Corruptions of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they ſaw many of their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples apparently contradicting, and others not very firmly founded upon the Holy Scriptures. And on the other hand they perceived the Neceſſity and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Reformation, they eaſily diſcovered that the whole Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was ſound and orthodox, and that they were now happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delivered from that Popiſh Slavery which their Forefathers ignorantly adored; and therefore being convinced of the Truth of their Religion, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came, and continued generally, very ſtrict Adherents and firm Obſervers of the Doctrine and Diſcipline of this Church.</p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:58558:201"/>
               <p>And here by the bye, I cannot but obſerve what a reverend Writer has lately inſinuated, relating to the Chriſtian Religion planted in <hi>Wales.</hi> For that Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Perſon in his Funeral Sermon upon Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> would fain induce the World to believe, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity was very corrupt and imperfect among the <hi>Welch,</hi> before it was purifyed by that, whom he terms Apoſtolical Man. Whereas it is notoriouſly evident, that ſince the Reformation was ſetled in that Country, and the Bible, with the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, tranſlated into the <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue, no place has been more exact, in keeping to the ſtrict Rubrick and Conſtitution of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both as to the Subſtance and Form of Worſhip. But what may more truly be attributed to Mr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> is that ſince his Travels into <hi>Wales,</hi> and the propagating of his Doctrine among the ignorant of that Country, Presbytery, which before had ſcarce taken root, has daily increaſed, and grown to a Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry,</hi> eldeſt Son of King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt, being arrived to the Age of Seventeen Years, was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> on the 30th. of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1610, but he dying of a malignant Feaver, about Two Years after; his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> being Fifteen Years of Age, was created Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> in his room, <hi>Anno</hi> 1615. For joy of this new Creation, the Town of <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and City of <hi>London,</hi> performed very great Triumphs; and the more to honour this Solemnity, the King made Twenty Five Knights of the Bath, all Lords or Barons Sons; and the Inns of Court, to expreſs their Joy, elected out of their Body Forty choice Gentlemen, to perform ſolemn Juſts and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryers.</p>

Ad hoc licet gauderemus de mora veſtra facienda in Wallia, tamen per nos non eritis impediti quin pax fiat, quantum in nobis eſt, quam optamus per veſtram induſtriam magis quam alicujus alterius roborari. Et ſperamus nec per Dei gratiam erit opportunum propter noſtram pertinaciam aliquid ſcribere Domino Papæ.

De eis verò quae fecimus contra Dominum, ut veri Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiani per Dei gratiam pœnitebimus, nec erit ex par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te noſtra quod bellum continuetur, dum ſumus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes ut debemus. Ne tamen exhæredemur &amp; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſim occidemur, oportet nos defendere ut valemus.
